I've had 2 other jobs in the past 3 years after relocating for my wife's job.  Each one I left because either because the company was looking to sell off the business (layoff potential), or management was terrible.  I feel like I've had a rough go of things.\\n\\nThe company I work for laid off 10% of the work force last year, then another noticeable amount in the past few weeks.  Sales are down.  They were going to eliminate my position too, and then ask me to move to another, which would have been fine, but then decided to keep my position.\\n\\nHR told me they kept me because they liked me, and they had another position open so they would use me to fill it.  It's still open.  I found out that another review is coming in April, but they're expecting demand to get better in the summer. So, lot's of uncertainty and no guarantees.\\n\\nI've wanted to stay with a company for at least a few years to decide if I want to stay for the long-term, and I'm worried I'll just get perceived as a job hopper that nobody wants.  Nevertheless, it can take a few months to find a new job in the event of layoff.  I have savings to handle that, but obviously want to avoid using it.\\n\\nI figure I have 3 options.  1) Stay and wait.  2) Go to HR to see if I can move to the other position, which is really needed, at the risk of making some upper management angry that vouched for my position.  3) Look elsewhere while waiting.\\n\\nThoughts?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":
