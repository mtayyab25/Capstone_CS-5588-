Everyone laid off in my tech company this week..,"My tech company was bought by another company in late '22 and we have been working to merge systems and products since then. We finally finished with the integration earlier this month and the expectation was a full integration of HQ and the other teams into the parent company starting in March. Our senior management (our former CEO etc) had recently moved into positions in the new company and our expectations were set that the next phase would be the integration and movement of management and below.

An all hands was called, not that out of the ordinary as we had those monthly but there was no link to the call, only a note that it would be sent out on the morning of. I thought that was weird, but I didn't think much of it. Come the morning of the call; I can't log into Slack for some reason when I sit down at my desk. Weird. Then a notice is sent out with a link for the all-hands call, and almost simultaneously, an email from the CEO hits the inbox stating that 'Unfortunately, due to the current business climate, difficult decisions had to be made, etc., etc..'

I jump on the call and all I see is an HR rep, so yeah, I know I'm fked now. Other people started to log in, and it wasn't just a few of us; it was everybody. They got rid of everyone in HQ, development, test, IT etc. No one from senior management came on, just the HR rep who 'understood how hard this must all be' and gave us some info on the next steps. 

My entire team, everyone. As a leader, I feel like I failed them as I was completely blindsided. Good people that worked well as a team. 

I've not been looking for a job as there had been no warning signs I had recognized; as far as we were all concerned, we were excited to find out where we were going to end up in the new org and excited to get working on more than integrating systems and modifying existing products. Obviously, in hindsight, that should have been a warning. I kept asking at weekly meetings, but I always got vague answers, or it was laughed off with ""We're still trying to figure out how X works, never mind integrating the teams! haha"". 

So, starting from step zero today, single income household, two kids in college, a mortgage, and I'm over 50 working in tech. I've not told my family other than my wife yet. I don't want the kids to stress, but we'll have to tell them soon, especially if it takes too long to get a new job and it affects their school stuff. 

Definitely going to need more scotch. "
No one thinks this has anything to do with layoffs?,"I’m 7 months into my search and I’ve definitely seen that dark hole. 

I know a few of you have too. 

And I’m here only because I was too afraid to commit to it really. 

I’ve gotten help since, which has been nice, I can still afford cobra, barely, but I can’t imagine everyone has the resources to survive for 7 months or even a year without serious damage. "
This is why layoff have consequences,"

Corporate America Has Abused the H1B Visa Program,The program was created to bring in experts but the program is being heavily abused. Companies have hired H1Bs to do things like manual QA work. These jobs do not require subject matter experts. They’ve been brought in to increase the supply of labor and lower labor costs. These programs hurt American workers and the only way to stop them is to ask our government to take some kind of action to protect American workers.
I am done with tech.,"This field does not bring joy but rather immense stress as the cycle of layoffs followed by a billion interviews followed by working my butt off for nothing has really burnt me out. I am planning on simplying my life and will probably move to a cheaper area and find a stable government job or something. The money was nice at first until you realize how high the cost of living is in these tech areas. I am glad I didn’t end up pulling the trigger on buying a house…. Sigh, just me ranting, thanks for hearing me out,"
45 and just laid off while on vacation. Feel like I am having a nervous breakdown. Any words of advice greatly appreciated.,"I am 45 years old, wife, 2 kids, house, etc. After working over 13 years as a software quality assurance manager I just found out yesterday while on vacation that I am getting laid off. Company decided to outsource the entire qa department. They offered me a ""bonus"" to stay on for an additional 8 weeks to train my replacements. I am thankful for that extra time but I am lying in bed thinking about family and freaking the F out! Wife makes shit for money so everything is on my shoulders. I honestly feel like I am going to have a nervous breakdown. I don't know what to do and am quite honestly scared to death. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind words, encouragement and loads of advice. I honestly can't express how much you all have helped. I know it will be hard but I WILL get another job and continue to provide for my family."
My first PIP taught me to never care about anything in a job except money,"When I started my career  I used to think 

1) you should root for your company's revenue, profit and be loyal

2) building a good relationship, listening to your manager, making your manager happy and outperforming will get you promoted 

3) your coworkers always have your back, help your coworkers as much as possible

4) trying hard at your job will always result in your growth

&#x200B;

Then I got PIPed, and I learned

1) conduct your career like a business, and be loyal to it, because all that matters is your revenue and profit

2) do everything from before PIP, BUT constantly try to replace your manager by searching new jobs, make sure you leave your job on good terms, but also ensure you are irreplaceable

3) no one has 'your' back, never help your coworkers until and unless there's some visibility associated with it. if you have helped someone make sure there's visibility associated with it

4) work efficiently at your job, but always try hard to switch jobs and increase your pay, it will always result in your growth  


(My experience is heavily biased by corporate culture, blue collar coworkers take real good care of each other is what I have heard)"
"Nike lays off more than 1,500 people as CEO says ‘I ultimately hold myself and my leadership team accountable’",Then lay you and your leadership off and promote someone else in the company to take their places.
Corporations should be fined for layoffs.,"I have seen too many corporations lay people off a few months after hiring them saying they need the help. They are playing with peoples lives and don't give a shit about the consequences. The corporation should be held responsible for shitty forecasting done by their employees.

They should be fined 15k per person if laid off in under 18 months or something. 

I know it will never happen but it isnt fair to be brought on and jump through all of their hoops, and think you are going to be ok only to be lied to and your life being back to upside down."

Advice from someone who's lived through 3 major recessions,"If we're going into a 2008 type meltdown, and it seems we are with this Sub being an early warning signal, here is my advice. This is a reactive advice, its far too late to prepare to do anything now. Largely, things will play out however they will. No one knows how bad its gonna get or how long it lasts.

Firstly, the most important thing to remember is that in a recession there is a lot of variability in the US. This is different from other countries. While many areas collapse in the US other area's seem to boom at the same time. Its bizarre and I can't explain it, but I've seen it many times. 

Secondly (but related to the first point) looking back on it I feel people fell into 3 categories in 2008:

1. Those who narrowly escaped getting hit and barely held on but kept jobs, homes etc.

2. Those who got hit hard but stayed in place and never really recovered. Maybe lost their homes. End up long-term renting living in shit conditions working Starbucks or shitjobs. No retirement and will likely never retire.

3. Those who got hit hard, lost jobs and homes but moved to where the opportunities were even if it meant going to the other side of the country and rebounded and went on to even greater things.

I guess you gotta hope you end up in #1.

But your plan B has got to be #3. 

I fell into #1, but had buddies that fell into both #2 and #3. 

Some of the #3 folks are now FAR more successful than me living in Arizona, California etc own their own business, bought homes again while I'm still freezing my nuts off in Eastern PA.

\#2 you gotta try and avoid at all costs.

That's really it. Apart from that, good luck with what comes next."
"17 years experience, can’t even get an interview","I’m frustrated and scared. I’ve been a software engineer for 17 years with a master’s and have never seen it this bad. I was laid off last year, a month after returning from medical leave (mental health leave because of burnout lol) and now I’m competing with 100s of people from Google, Facebook, et al. 

Basically I’ve been out of a job for a year and I’m 43 so I guess I’m unhireable at this point. I can’t believe this is the system everyone just goes along with and doesn’t question in any meaningful way: you have to have experience, but not too much experience, not be middle aged, and you absolutely cannot stop working for any reason or you’re damaged goods. 

EDIT: Thank y’all. You’ve all given me something to think about. I’m going to change my approach. Māhalo!"
Im on my 5th layoff in my career since 2009. Here is what I learned about myself.,"1.  I am just a number to my company no matter how many years Ive been at a company, nor how hard nor how loyal of an employee I am. 

2.  The first layoff in 2009 was like a punch to my gut. I loved my career and ny team. I was at that company for 13 years and part of three mass layoffs in two years. I was also the breadwinner in my family with a 2 year old son and husband who didnt think we would lose our home. We lost it alright and Wells Fargo scammed us after paying 13 months of savings to try to keep our home. It was ended in foreclosure. Huge lessons learned. 

3.  Take a contract job if you can. It took me NINE long months to find a contact role while LinkedIn was still very new and unknown after layoff one. 

4.  Stay at a company at least 2-3 years but dont expect to get high raises. Negotiate your salary and at best, expect 3% max. Which I why you should continue to look for your next role after 2-3 years. 

5.  Layoffs 2-5 were all re org related. I took them in stride after my first one and learned how to network, hustle and be ahead of the game, always able to find my next role within 3-5 months. I also met alot of amazing people along the way and how different global brands functioned on the inside (good and bad). Take the good key learnings and leverage that as part of what you can offer to scale growth into your next role. That usually has been my selling point to beat my competitors during job hunts. 

6.  Learn to live within your means.  I cannot stress this enough. Cut back on as much as possible. 10 years after my first layoff, after divorce and being a single minority woman, I have been debt free for the past three years  and now positioned towards build generational wealth.   There is light at the end of the tunnel and now appreciate having been laid off in 2008. Had I not, I would still be at my first company going on 25 years with little to no career nor salary advancement. 

7.  Last but not least…. Continue learning new skills. Both hard and soft skills. 

Added -#8. Reach out to contract recruiters and let them know you are looking. Stay in contact with them every few weeks. Also, surprisingly, posting my resume years ago on Monster.com has netted me leads and jobs. I just got hit up for Director level roles this morning directly via text for a FinTech role. They are actively looking is my point but I suggest you post your updated resume that reflect KPIs. 

Hope this helps someone. There is light at the end. You just have to learn how to weather the storm out."
20+ years…laid off today,"I was laid off unceremoniously today. Upper management. Clothing company. I wasn’t the only one, it was myself and the other DM with the longest tenure like myself. And the two newest hires. 
We were told on a phone call. We had 3 hours to do our last expense reports, empty out our offices and our cars and leave it all for someone to pick up. 
I can’t get HR to return my calls or emails. No severance package. 
We do get our accrued vacation. 
I am so hurt. Embarrassed. Pissed off. And in disbelief. I’m not financially worried. I’m floored and have no clue what to do now. 
I am shocked I am this emotional about it. 
Any advice anyone? Thanks."
"25,000 Tech Workers Laid Off In January 2024","I didn't realize the number was so high (or I'd never bothered to add it all up). I was also surprised to learn 260,000 tech jobs vanished in 2023. Citing a correction after the pandemic ""hiring binge"" seems to be their go-to explanation. I think it's bullocks: 

>All of the major tech companies conducting another wave of layoffs this year are sitting atop mountains of cash and are wildly profitable, so the job-shedding is far from a matter of necessity or survival. 

[https://www.npr.org/2024/01/28/1227326215/nearly-25-000-tech-workers-laid-off-in-the-first-weeks-of-2024-whats-going-on](https://www.npr.org/2024/01/28/1227326215/nearly-25-000-tech-workers-laid-off-in-the-first-weeks-of-2024-whats-going-on)"
I quit tech,"10 years in tech. My first few were at a unicorn startup in SF in a social media role. Eventually it was determined all non-critical roles were to be offshored. Got laid off.

That inspired me to self-teach coding and become critical. I spent the next 6+ years as a software engineer building a startup and achieving several promotions along the way. That startup ultimately got acquired for over over $1B. Got laid off.

Joined a new tech company, this time as a director. My mission? Set up the systems to bring offshore work in-house. Awesome, right? Once my job was complete just some 6 months later… got laid off.

Feeling disconnected from the living I wanted to make and the effort I put in, I said fuck it. I joined a financial organization as a level 1 account executive doing hardcore sales (no previous experience). Funny part is I can easily double my tech director salary in this new role.

I’ve never been happier. I have amazing coworkers and satisfying work with uncapped earnings, all while doing a job that’s focused on building relationships. It makes the “virtuous” Silicon Valley vibes I’ve been immersed in feel so fake. And it feels awesome to break free and see through the veil.

If there are any layoff soldiers out there considering a drastic change, just do it. You may be surprised how positively things can turn out. Always keep what’s important front of mind: family, friends, and how you make people feel. Good luck everyone!"

US salaries are falling. Employers say compensation is just 'resetting',
Friendly Reminder: Please don’t put your “heart & soul” in jobs where you’re working for someone else. ,"I’ve been in so many behind the scenes meetings with executives over the decades. They refer to employees as “labor costs”. They regularly complain about the cost of health insurance for their employee population. They see employees as “costs”. 

They often don’t even mouth the word layoff, instead they use sterile corporate terms like “opportunities for cost reduction” and “synergies”. They never bring up your heart and soul. They are not interested in how much hard work you’ve invested. 

You don’t need to see them as your enemy or be angry at companies. Just see them for what they are… *a collection of wealthy people trying to make as much money as they can using as few employees as possible*. They are not your friends nor family. Your real friends and family matter in this life. Save up your money so that you can take care of your real family when your fake family “decides to make the very difficult decision to eliminate your role” via email and locks you out of your their fake “family home.”  Good luck to all.

Laid off yesterday after only 8 weeks employment,"I quit my job after 10 years with the company to work at another company. Hiring person talked about how well the company was doing and growing, so I hired on. Started October 30 and laid off yesterday!!  

Owner claims that they had a very bad month and not enough new sales coming in for them to keep me.  WTF?


Update

The company that I quit after ten years, offered me a supervisory position, so, since no one else is hiring, I’ll be starting back Monday. "
got let go!,"

i started working there back in november, i loved it, and i have experience with baking and especially decorating, so i was good at dressing cookies. i didn’t have that many friends at work, and all the people my age were pretty rude to me except for one. my last two shifts, valentine’s day they let me go early and then that monday after they told me not to come in. along with that they lost my vaccination records and servsafe certificate, and tried to blame me for it and it would have cost me money to get new copies of them. 

im just confused why they’re letting me go and saying it’s because they have experienced less business, as we’ve been having issues being understaffed and having to constantly hire new people. 

there have also been issues with the owner paying us improperly, skimming hours and not complying with the minimum wage increase. 

im sad i really liked working there. "
Finally Got a Job Offer!,"I got laid off in November, and I finally got an offer.

I'll be making $10k over what I was previously making, fully remote with benefits. 

This was after applying religiously to 1310 jobs, 40 total interviews (31 of those only first initial call interviews) with 29 companies and 120+ days of insecurity - and a lot of rejections (225 complete rejections, 993 no responses/ghosting). 

It was a lot of work, tears, and heartbreak - and some people here have been on the hunt longer than I have. I hope this may help some of you who are still on the search. 

Remember you're human, take needed breaks from the job search (there were times I took a week off of it just to help my mental clarity), and use your support system. "
Made nearly 200k and now taking a job where they want me on call and weekends for $80k. As a contractor. ,"To their credit they offered me $90k. But I’ll be a contractor. Not W2. 

They said they might be willing to pay my cobra premiums from my last job?

Idk. I’m not particularly excited and almost feel like “well it’s not being unemployed and it’s money”

But fuck, I made $120k before getting promoted to my last job where I made nearly $200k. 

Now I’m at 90k but I feel I’ll just get fucked on taxes. 

I guess it’s a move in the right direction. 7 months of unemployment makes you question your own life being worth living tbh. "
Is it me or are we being gaslit? I can’t tell.,"How are prices soaring, wages terrible, and large swaths of layoffs the best economy?

I’m trying to not be an energy vampire to everyone around me but being in the fourth month of my layoff, I think constantly about how shit life is."
I Feel So Broken,"Back in November, I was laid off from a job I loved and did well, after 3 years of employment. Positive feedback, several awards, great performance reviews, everything I could do to be a standout employee. I was still let go. Completely blindsided.

Since then, I have submitted 316 job applications.

Received 174 rejections outright.
Gotten 33 first interviews.
19 second interviews.
12 third interviews.
5 fourth interviews.
2 final interviews, one of which I desperately wanted.

I've attended 41 webinars and taken 7 courses related to job searching. I've revamped my resume, used AI resources to ensure keyword matches, worked with other jobseekers on role plays, watched countless YouTube videos on applying and landing a job and it has all amounted to nothing but rejection and heartache.

I have a master's degree, 8 years of solid professional experience in a sought after field, excellent references and still, nothing.

Every ghosting, every rejection, has eaten away at me. At my soul, my self confidence, my happiness, my hope. 

I have worked so hard, put so much of myself into every single application, every interview, every presentation and panel and assessment and technical exercise.

How much longer until there's nothing left?

I've already been asked why I haven't managed to land a job yet despite working more than a full time job at trying to land one. I said it's because I'm being selective and holding out for the right fit... but how long will that excuse hold water?

My unemployment runs out at the end of March. When I got laid off, I never would have thought it would take me this long to find something, even if it wasn't something permanent. Now, I'm really afraid that my unemployment will run dry and I don't know what I will do if that happens.

Can anyone relate?"
Another one bites the dust,"I was laid-off from my tech job two weeks ago. It was 100% remote. My manager was a nice dude that did a great job. I got to work with smart folks from around the globe. Damn, I loved that job. 

I had survived multiple sweeping layoffs during my 6 years at the company. I knew it could be me one day, but did not think it was my time. I was actually looking forward to my annual review.

When I got a vague same-day calendar invite about an important business change, I assumed I was being put on a new project team. What an odd mix of attendees, I thought. 

Unfortunately, there was no new project and I was laid-off in a meeting with a bunch of us senior-level individual contributors. It was like a sad corporate Brady Bunch on my screen, looking around at each other in disbelief. 

Nobody reminded us, but the first thing I did after receiving the news was cash-in my employee recognition points. We had this program where you could give and receive points for a job well done and use them to buy all kinds of stuff. I used my points for a new record player. 

Then I tackled important stuff like the paperwork and returning equipment. I updated my resume and began my search. The record player arrived only three days later. 

I was riding high after publishing my hashtag opentowork post on LinkedIn. I received so many encouraging messages from former colleagues and basked in the cheap dopamine while listening to sad records. 

I haven't cried about getting laid-off from the job I loved - but maybe that's why the new Bachelor's journey to find love has me sobbing. Emotions find a way out, don't they.

It's tough out there to put it mildly, but there are many open positions for similar roles and I've been thoughtfully applying to all of them. I have my first interview tomorrow. I'm sure it's just a screening and if I'm lucky I'll move on to numerous rounds of interviews, but I am feeling good.

I choose to lean into this delulu optimism I've been feeling. I'm also leaning into my hobbies like vegetarian cooking, low-impact exercise, writing and listening to sad records. I'm fortunate enough to be prepared for this on all fronts. 

I will be okay. You will be okay, too. Good luck to all of us.

"Save as much as you can, you'll not have a tech job forever","I work at a FAANG, and I have now accepted that I'll not have this job forever, something that I used to think in 2021. Some day, some exec would think that my job isn't really needed. 

I would be ecstatic if I have this job for 5 more years because I think in 5 years, I'll likely have enough to FIRE. I think I'm 1/3rd the way there. 

My strategy these days is to be as frugal as possible and invest in the market (total market, SPY and QQQ because I don't play with individuals stocks). And hopefully these investments will rise. 

My advice to you guys would be to start saving and investing as much as you can and live well below your means. I understand that for many of you with children and mortgage it's not possible. 

Hope we all survive this"
"The more layoffs I see, the less motivated I am to work at all.","I feel like one major goal of executives with these layoffs (among several reasons) is that they want to ”scare”  workers. Scare them back into the office, scare them to work longer hours, scare them to accept lower pay, scare them into compliance, etc.

But with every layoff I see, the more strict my boundaries around work become. My company did 3 rounds of layoffs totaling between 4/500 people. The last major round was 9 months ago. That, combined with all the other layoffs I’m seeing in tech (I work in tech), makes me less and less motivated to work more or work harder. If my head is on the chopping block at any point in time, I don’t see how or why I should dedicate myself to something that absolutely will not dedicate itself to me.

This feels like a race to the bottom for both employees and employers. Everyone is exhausted. No one trusts executive leadership. And the more layoffs that happen the deeper this mistrust and exhaustion goes.

Anyone else feeling this way?"
Amazon Layoffs,"I was laid off yesterday. 

My leader said: “This has nothing to do with your performance. This decision was not made lightly.”

Yet its so hard to think it’s not based on my performance. They kept people who had less tenure and experience than me (but paid the same)

I asked 100x over my course of tenure there to give me more exposure, to include me in more meetings, to give me more context. From the start, I felt left out. I was set up to fail and not given the opportunity to grow. They often took credit for the things that I BUILT. 

Live and learn I guess."

This economy is shit. 

My background has primarily been in sales and my last role was operations based. Thought I successfully made the shift there too. 

Wrong.

I'll update this list as long as people seem interested.

I run a small business in the IT sector. The company has a current staffing level of 24 employees, and back in August 2023 we posted for 2 positions (1 DevOps, and 1 Full Stack Developer). The entire process took 3 months, all the way into mid-November, and thankfully we hired two very qualified candidates. Now here's what I noticed from that round of hiring that was different than previous years, including pre-COVID. Not to sound the alarm, but perhaps some of this may be of interest to those still looking for work and wanting to know the reality of the labor market.

1. **The amount of applications literally tripled compared to the norm.** In 2019, or 2020, for a typical position posting our HR contact would receive roughly 20-30 applications during a 30 day period. So a little less than 1 a day. For this last round of hiring, we received roughly 200+ applications for each job posting until we cut it off. 3-4 applications a day literally. It was overwhelming and we had not seen such volume before.
2. **The quality of candidate was extremely high.** This is speaking in terms of experience and credentials. We were getting UC Berkeley, or UT grads with multiple years experience working with FAANG/MAMAA companies. These people were extremely qualified, young, and motivated. They cut through our technical skills test like butter. We had never seen this before, usually we would get 3 or 4 individuals who clearly stood out, and made filtering easy. But this was the toughest time we've had narrowing down candidates in our companies history.
3. **Over half of these applicants were recent layoffs or furloughed employees.** Now this is the most shocking information IMO. During normal years, our applicant pool might be 10-15% recent layoffs (probably lower), or people who were fired from their previous position. But I estimated that around 60-70% of our most recent applicant pool were recent layoffs, many had gaps of 3-6 months, and some even had 12 month gaps. It was shocking to see such a stagnant pool of skilled labor that was still looking for work after so long. Never seen it before.

I really wish the best for those who were recently laid off and are still looking. Don't get down on yourself if you're getting rejections from companies, it's probably not because you're not qualified. The simple fact is the labor market is at a point where the amount of job postings is decreasing, and the amount of qualified applicants who are looking for work seems to be increasing. Good luck out there.

"This morning, I e-mailed my recruiter to confirm an interview. She replied and said it was confirmed. By the afternoon, the time of the interview, she had been laid off. It's really bad out there.","I was absolutely dumbfounded. At the time of my interview, I got a call from a different recruiter, who indicated that the person with whom I had been working was no longer with the company. For perspective, I had just interacted with the previous recruiter in the morning. This was an internal recruiter (not third-party) at a fortune 500. The new recruiter proceeded to interview me and it was the most bizarre interaction I've ever had in a recruiting cycle in my career."

To-Do's if you think layoffs are coming.,"Quick list of things to do if you think layoffs are coming (or if you've been laid off and living on a severance package).

Assuming you have/had insurance:

* **Go to the doctor** and get checked out. Get any scrips filled for 90 days.
* **Go to the dentist**. Get that cleaning/filling/check-up done. 
* **Get your eyes checked** and a new pair of glasses. 

If your insurance covers it, look for mental health coverage and start talking to someone. This one is sort of an ace in the hole. You never know you need it till you need it and it can be hard to get into.

Don't try and be a tough guy. Therapy helps. A Lot.

Use every drop of your benefits dollars.

* **Start burnishing your resume NOW**. Update your LinkedIn. Reach out and connect with ANYONE you can use as a reference. 
* **Start looking for a new job NOW.** Don't wait for the layoff notice. Start looking now.

If you're ahead of the curve and see layoffs coming and your company has educational reimbursement, start getting certifications. Many take some time, but being able to put current certifications on your resume will help a lot.

40 and recovering from 10 months of being laid off,"EDIT: People keep asking me to add to this post details about my animal rescue. I'm not going to do that as I feel monetizing that way would be disingenuous. I just wanted to lend my experience and offer support to anyone else. I can give that info out through chat if you want it. Much love and respect to everyone here.

\------------------------

Just figured I'd share how I survived my layoff experience in tech with a SAH wife and child, and having 2 mother in laws to care for in TX.

I'm 40 and work in IT. Oct 2022 I was laid off from my Sys Admin job. Got 2 months severance. Immediately I noticed the job market drying up. Everyone was doing a hiring freeze, whether out loud or silently. I figured I'd get a job even though everyone was stopping hiring since I had almost 2 decades of experience. YEAH NOPE. Applying for jobs is like screaming into the void or talking to a wall. Recruiters ghost you, HR doesn't call back, interviews cut off halfway through and never finish. I couldn't get a job for 10 months, and even still it's only a part time contractor position for a MSP. This even included ""entry level"" positions outside my field. Emergency fund...gone, retirement set way back, credit damaged now too just from staying afloat. I think I aged 20 years and probably need about 3 months of therapy.

Here's list of things that worked for me to survive:

If I could give any advice for other people with families, find every state program to join. You pay for it in taxes, use it. You can get free food, utility bills paid, etc depending on the state. TX is a little rough on the support system but even here has programs to join.  [www.findhelp.org](http://www.findhelp.org/)

Watch your pride. It'll cause more damage than good when you're struggling. You also need positive influences around you, so cut off the negative people in your circle. I was so tired of hearing ""just apply for more jobs"" or ""get a recruiter"" from people.

I collected every penny of unemployment, which barely covers anything but kept food coming in and some bills paid.

We immediately started a small business and a nonprofit (animal rescue). It's easier and cheaper than you think. Reselling has a low barrier to entry and there is cheap or free inventory everywhere (goodwill, storage units, garage sales, etc). eBay selling and doing rummage sales is your friend. I cleaned out peoples houses of junk and sold in any parking lot that would let me. The nonprofit was a way to reduce my taxes on some of my property and it's just like any other business. Plus it put me in contact with many good people of my community, which helped immensely.

Mortgage was put on hold by my lender by going through loss mitigation (absolutely do this sooner than later, I should have started this process immediately on layoff as it took 3 months start to finish after I was already 2 months behind)

Apply for homeowner assistance. (TX has a program, TXHAF.) They paid an entire year of my mortgage  but it took 4 months of paperwork and going back and forth.

Credit cards went on hold, unless we needed to survive on one. Chase was good about this, others were not. If anything credit wise defaults or gets shut down, get a debt lawyer to deal with it. It's worth the fees to consolidate or haggle a settlement plus your brain is gonna be stuck on survival mode.

Birthday party gifts, Christmas presets, school/kid functions....unfortunately all that stuff has to stop immediately. You can't afford it, even if there's money in the bank. Sucks, I know, but every dollar counts. Wife hated this part as she's a gift giver.

&#x200B;

Overall, my advice is take action quickly on layoff. Don't expect a job quickly in this market. If you can afford it, maybe take a week or two to process losing your job but not much longer than that.

There's light at the end of the tunnel but man does it feel hopeless while you're in it. My only hope is that I can offer help or assistance to the next person going through a really bad layoff experience (I don't think there are any good ones though). I'm not out of the woods yet either but at least the wolves are at bay. I'm open to chat with anyone that needs emotional support.

Training your replacement after being laid off is criminal,"Exactly as the title says. My team was told it was being laid off a couple months ago and outsourced to another country. This obviously hit our members hard and morale has been pretty low as we get towards the end. But now my company is trying to make us train our replacements, most of whom do not speak our language natively. This should never fall on the outgoing team, it should fall squarely on the company management that decided they wanted to outsource us to train them. They laid us off, why would we care if the new team knows what they’re doing? Sorry for the rant buts it’s frustrating so I’m screaming into the void."

No one told me…,"Do you have any?

For people considering a job in tech, here are things I wish someone had told me before I took my first job …

- Never ever trust anyone in HR regardless of what they say. Request privacy? They will say sure and then ignore. 

- Hope for the best. Plan for the worst, layoffs.  Seriously, plan. Not a f*ckn joke. 

- If a company says they value their team members, that’s conditional. Good times yes. Bad times no.  Everyone is at risk. 

- Learn what “at will employment” means. Use it. Your employer will use it on you. And it will suck unless you are prepared. 

- Quickly get a side hustle going. There will be a point where you will need to temporarily rely on those funds. 

- Do not ever sacrifice time with family for the business."
Regulate layoffs,"We cannot allow these companies to post record profits and line the pockets of their executives and shareholders while continuing to cut jobs needed by the middle and working class.

 I have heard that in some EU countries such as France and Germany, that companies must prove that they are under a certain degree of financial stress in order to initiate layoffs.

 Introducing a bill with similar provisions at the national level in the United States would likely go nowhere. Let’s face it, many of our politicians are complicit in allowing these companies to profit off the backs of middle and working class Americans. 

I’m hoping this post sparks conversations at the local and state level to prevent mass layoffs without cause from happening in the future. Anyone else got any ideas on how we may work towards getting this practice regulated?

Wife laid off after 23 years and feels guilty. Looking for words of wisdom.,"Edit:  Thanks everyone, some sound advise and very much appreciated.   For those that are still looking, I wish you the best.

My wife 43 just got a 7 day notice that she is being let go.  She is a manager at Macy's in Oregon and has been with the company 22 years. 3 merit raises and a promotion over the last  2 years.  HR confirms not performance related.

 They told her they were eliminating one of the three manager jobs.  They kept a manager with 1.5 years experience and one with only 6 months that hardly knows how to operate the POS system.  

She is feeling extremely hurt/blindsided/backstabbed as well as a ton of guilt as she believes she is going to hurt the family.  I've told her over and over that it isn't her fault but we all know how that goes when roles are reversed.  

I will admit I have the shit personality trait of stuff happens along with not getting very emotional about things.  Kind of a suck it up and drive on mentality. I honestly have googled sayings to write on get well/condolence cards :(  My wife is the polar opposite.  

That being said, kind of looking for some advise or maybe what has worked for someone in a similar situation.  

Thanks in advance"

Unpopular Opinion: Lower your expectations (Tech),"For the next few years, it looks like you FAANG people or similar will have to adjust to lower salaries, in person work and competition. Stay out of debt if you can. Go work for a factory doing their IT or alike. Many will refrain from getting these sort of jobs yet will get in significant debt while waiting. Truth is that many of you have been very highly compensated and it’s not something that may repeat very soon. Be proactive please and once you get a new job, save."
Do you regret going into tech? ,"Most of the people here are software engineers. And yes, we used to have it so good. Back in 2019, I remember getting 20 messages per month from different recruiters trying to scout me out. It was easy to get a job, conditions were good. 

Prior to this, I was sold on the “learn to code” movement. It promised a high paying job just for learning a skill. So I obtained a computer science degree. 

Nowadays, the market is saturated. I guess the old saying of what goes up must come down is true. I just don’t see conditions returning to the way they once were before. While high interest rates were the catalyst, I do believe that improving AI will displace some humans in this area. 

I am strongly considering a career change. Does anyone share my sentiment of regret in choosing tech? Is anyone else in tech considering moving to a different career such as engineering or finance? "

Today marks my 9 months of unemployment,"So, I was in a tech company post my MBA, giving it my all, you know: it was my first real career job. But then bam! Got hit with a layoff, even though I was acing those yearly reviews. Six years deep in the Product Team, pulling in a sweet six figures.

I remember chatting with HR right after the pink slip, and I turned down this remote opportunity cause the pay was only around 75k/annually. Now I'm kicking myself for that snap decision. Had no clue the job market was gonna be this brutal. ‘I had the experience, the expertise and drive, I will land in a better paying job’ I had thought. 

Lesson learned, folks: Take what you can get, any job with any pay. While you're grinding away, keep your eyes peeled for better opportunities and stay open to networking. You never know where it might lead.

If you ask me, unemployed of 9 months is bad- on wallet, on resume, on my mental health. It’s just awful

Signs a Layoff May be Coming,"Curious if anyone has any war stories about impending layoffs. I feel like having been hit with a few over the years there are certain tell-tale signs that a layoff ""might"" be coming sooner rather than later. 

My list:

* **Contractors.** If a company I work for starts hiring contractors to do the jobs similar to what I'm doing, I start to get worried. 
* **Business slow down.** If the day to day work I would normally be doing starts to get weirdly slow, like slow in ways I cant account for, that gets me thinking layoffs might be coming.
* **Sudden Work-Time studies.** This is another one that get's me worried when my work place wants to ""document"" the work load. Could be that they just want to account for all productivity time, but if I'm having to record what I'm doing, its a red flag. 

What else am I missing? Any other tell-tale signs a layoff might be coming?"
Just got laid off after 24 years,"As a now former contractor for the federal government I do understand that the job could go away at any time for any reason. I’d been with this US agency for 24 years across 5 companies/contracts and different orgs.

When your manager from your company calls you in and tells you the gov is no longer funding your position and that tomorrow is your last day..well it’s a gut punch! 

Just remember, for you it may be personal, for them, it’s business. 

I did get 3 weeks severance and my accrued leave up to 80 hours so there is that.

I’m still processing this, my sleep (none?) last night was terrible. 

It would be easy for me to rage and imagine conspiracy, but I figure there is no gold or satisfaction to be had picking up the shovel and digging in that dirt mound.

So, here I am the night after turning things in at work and just at this point wanting a good night sleep so I can file for unemployment, look up ACA details and update my resume.

I’m here and so are you. I don’t know you but we share the same pain. We’ll be ok.

Don’t Believe Some Idiots About Performance Layoff,"Some jerk recently posted on here that layoffs are performance based. This is absolutely not true especially in the current climate. My entire org from VP down was laid off. And no, it was not some underperforming org. Sometimes cost cutting decisions are made without considering performance. Me personally, if it was a performance reason, then every review I’ve got over the past 5+ years where I exceeded expectations and got the performance bonuses to back that up, is a lie.

My point is- if you believe that they are performance based then fine, (even if it’s not true), but don’t post your nonsense here and kick people while they’re already down.

Edit to add: About a month and a half later, they tried to hire me back with the condition that I repay severance and then tried to negotiate a contract role that was project-based at an hourly rate just above my base salary. I declined both.

Edit2: I made a generalization after getting angry at that comment. A lot of people have provided valuable anecdotes. It seems that at some places, layoffs are a way to let go of underperformers. Fair enough. But it helps no one for a person to rudely come to a layoff subreddit and insult everyone who is clearly going through a hard time by assuming they were essentially fired and are poor performers."

Tech could be a total bloodbath for the next 5 years,"I've just been told by one of my buddies that his CEO is taking a scorched earth approach to the adoption of AI based on a recommendation from one of the big consulting groups. Its not a SAAS outfit, but mainly does product and non-OEM support. After one year (and 15% less staff) the perception in their board rooms is that AI is far too powerful and adoption is far too slow due to internal resistance from middle management trying to preserve their empires.

Outcome? Bataan death march ...

The plan is to force the adoption of AI by letting go of another 20% or so of staff that are doing actual productive or revenue generating ticket work. The theory here is the salary savings preserve the bottom line and the top line output is maintained because the remaining staff will be forced to adopt AI due to the struggle as a way to cope. This is modern day Bridge over the River Kwai stuff (without the Japanese torture off-course).  At the end of the process you have a much leaner organization doing largely the same volume of product output.

He's been told that this approach has now successfully been tried and tested in Q3/Q4 2023 and they're ready to roll it out industry wide. Sadly I think the tech job market is going to be a bloodbath for the next 5 years."

6 things I wish I have done before I got laid off.,"1- Put in the work to network. Odds are 10/1 of them will get you an interview or will be willing to put in the work to get you one. Join a community or two and make meaningful connections with people. If you are tired of technical / work stuff start taking that Japanese courses you wanted to take, meet people you normally wouldn't meet outside of work.  


2- If you are currently employed and in your job you are comfortable be **very afraid**. Your manager is knowingly or unknowingly screwing you over by giving you tasks which does not challenge you.  Make the extra effort to learn something relevant in the industry better yet move. It will be time consuming and much more difficult to acquire relevant skills if/when you are laid off.

3- Business is not your friend, it is not your family, they don't care about you, they may address you as ""talent"" but they only see you as necessary burden . Make selfish decisions whenever it is convenient. Never make sentimental decisions when it involves the company like staying around because they need you when you can move on to something better.  You will get caught off guard when they betray your trust. Your manager you thought you were very close will betray you in a heart beat. We are all human, we all have bills to pay.

4- Start working on that side business right now, invest time and money in to it whenever you can. Ship something, make something, learn something. When you loose your job even if it doesn't help you much financially it will help you mentally.

5- Save up some money, in fact save as much as you can. This sounds like a non brainer but it is easier said then done. For those of us who got burned we now know how the industry can turn upside down suddenly. For those who haven't experienced the layoffs I really hope you can take this advice before experiencing it your selves.

6- Pay closer attention to how corrupt and greedy corporations can be in America and maybe consider doing something to change things for the better. Coal miners who lost their jobs , their cities turned to ghost towns , automotive industry workers who are struggling. As a white collar worker most of us didn't do sh\*t about it. I think it is about time we realize we are in the same boat as those who's jobs got replaced by machines or their jobs got offshored. Most of us never asked how will they cope ? how will they feed their families. We need to challenge the system to make it a bit better for everyone . If you complain in the current society you will get shut down but If you help those other than your self you may get your voice heard."
Terminated and lost,"I got terminated from a SaaS company in NYC. When I asked why, the HR Director told me because of ""gross misconduct"", however, she didn't give any details about what the exact misconduct was. I filed for unemployment insurance. When the insurance company asked my former employer what the misconduct was, they weren't able to give a valid reason. 

Through a former co-worker, I found out that my direct report had falsely accused me of having opened his personal mail.

Instead of properly investigating, the company just terminated my employment. Since my visa was bound to the company, I had to leave the US and move back to Europe, losing a lot of friends and my center of life. When I appealed the decision, the company made seem as if I was the most horrible person in the world and also accused me of physically attacking my co-worker all the time. 

I am a very calm person and I always try to solve issues through dialogue and communication.  

This whole thing is a nightmare and am constantly contemplating suicide. Right now I have no idea how to deal with this. I  loved this job so much and I loved living in New York. Right now i just feel like a worthless piece of shit that needs to be put down...

Been laid off twice in the last year. Job market is unbearable. Anyone else feeling the dread?,"So I’m earlier on in my career I’m 24 and have dealt w layoffs twice in the last year (at one company for a year, left went to another company, laid off, went to another company, laid off in September after almost a year) and I just am feeling so exhausted.

I haven’t even gotten the chance to progress in my career because I can’t seem to pick a company where they DONT lay people off. 

I was up for a promotion at my last role but was cut due to layoffs. I work in tech sales, and it’s so SO hard to move up and I was finally there. I feel like now I can only get jobs I’m overqualified for and dread. I feel like all my work over almost the last 3 years is for nothing. I’m gunna have to start where I began. It feels so frustrating. None of my friends and family really understand how bad it is. My friends have been at their companies since graduation or really like their job. I feel almost embarrassed I lack that. 

I know layoffs are out of my control. But I feel like no one around me actually gets how difficult navigating the job market is right now if you don’t want to take steps back in your career. 

Only interviews I can get are new grad jobs and unlivable pay. I shouldn’t feel this frustrated and let down this early in my career.

I’m doing all the right things to find a better role for myself. Networking in person/LinkedIn, reaching out to hiring managers/recruiters, leveraging my personal and professional network, getting referrals, tailoring my resume/cover letters, expanding and working on my skills. It all leads to dead ends or they just go with another candidate. I’ve been in multiple final rounds. I’m putting more work into this job search then an actual job. 

How are people navigating multiple layoffs and the current job market when earlier on in their career?"
Laid off. Boss took all of the credit for my work and ended up in a magazine.,"
I'm holding some details back to protect my privacy, but man I need to vent. I'm so mad... I got laid off last summer along with several others from a very late stage startup that's nearing IPO. The job market has been absolutely brutal, not just for me but most of my colleagues are struggling too. None of the people laid off made any sense, the roster was all senior, top contributors, people who had and were continuing to make significant impact on the companies growth. The revenue brought in more than covered their own existence. We were given a b.s. reason about ""redundancies and cost cutting"". I have suspicions it was motivated by greed and recovering unvested stock options...but that's off topic.

I was hired to build a strategic program to expand our reach globally and accelerate revenue growth. I held sole responsibility and ownership (as described in my position description). I have a unique background that fit what was needed very specifically. My boss, whom hired me, was fired 6 months after I started. I worked my a** off even after he was gone and I was in limbo without leadership. I traveled constantly, and at one point I spent an entire month away from home. 

A couple months later, in comes my new boss. I was picking up slimy, dirt bag vibes from him immediately and did not trust him at all. I stayed in my lane, did everything I could to help him while still completing the job I was hired for. I ended up going to HR with a complaint at one point because he was sending me in circles and away from role. He was burying me in mundane tasks not even associated to my role. I talked to another close coworker about him and was told to give him a chance, so I did, trusted him and supported him as a supervisor as much as I could. I decided I could trust him, he was a good dude, and I was just wrong. 

5 months after he was hired I launched the program and it received a lot of positive media attention across our industry (great for growth and marketing). 

Less than 2 months after the launch I was invited to the dreaded HR call and laid off. The provided a long list of names of who else was let go or retained. Over a year of sacrifice and working my butt off went down the drain and I didn't benefit from my work in any way other than professional networking. The company benefitted substantially.

Now here I am ~8 months later, getting by on unemployment and burning down my savings. I've applied to more jobs than I can count, been through several exhaustive interview rounds just to not make it at the final cut. I had a verbal offer with one of the most well known brands dependent on headcount budget and waited 2 months for that role only to be told the funding was only approved for a different region and they asked if I'd move. I had to say no.

....I opened a magazine that's specific to my industry yesterday, and what do I see...My old bosses face in an article taking full credit for my hard work. He was never involved, just updated him on progress so he could relay to the CEO/CRO. This is also the only ""accomplishment"" they recognized. The corporate world can be rough, but man, some people are just awful humans with no conscious or morals.

Rant off.

TLDR; I spent over a year building a strategic business unit from scratch. Got laid off 2 months after a very successful launch. Boss took all the credit and ended up in a magazine claiming it was his work."

I've been lurking here providing support where I can, hoping others won't go through what I have. Getting laid off a year ago from the firm I spent 18 years at growing and building a solid reputation was devastating, I'm absolutely terrified to do it all again. And all with a smile on my face. 

Sorry for the rant, I know what I need to do. I'm updating my resume now and getting my ducks in a row to apply for unemployment once my tiny severance is paid. I just want to work some place where I won't be thrown in the trash at some senior VP's whim to change directions. Sigh.

I wish I could start my own business but I have no marketable skills or abilities (like artistic or culinary work) so I'm not really sure where to start there. 

And I had no idea that my experience is common, let alone how it  could be worse. I'm so sorry for everyone who found themselves in a similar position, I'm totally rooting for you!! "

It May Not Seem Like it but Getting Laid Off Right Now Might Be a Blessing in Disguise,"There are a lot of posts, articles, shorts, etc. going around right now about people getting laid off and I wanted to give a little bit of encouragement. 

Over 10 years ago early in my career, basically my 1st corporate job out of college, my entire department was laid off. Luckily, I was one of a few that got to interview and was offered another position within the company. I remember that everyone was sad, but there were people that were 50+ years old and/or close to retirement being just devastated and blindsided about the layoff. But I mostly remember one person that had a side hustle and money saved that didn't allow this blip in their career to phase them. 

That layoff shaped me and my career. It taught me to never be complacent. It taught me to keep my resume up to date. There were some rock stars in that group that was laid off and it taught me that you are always replaceable no matter how much you think you're killing it at your job. It taught me that I need to have an emergency fund saved. It taught me that I needed to have another stream of income. It taught me that I need to be able to swallow my pride and that my career right now does not define me and that if I need to flip burgers, wait tables or fold clothes in a department store to survive I can do that and it does not make me less than. It taught me to live below my means. It taught me to be focused about saving for retirement and building generational wealth.It taught me to set a goal that I need to be out of the corporate game by the time I'm 50 to 55 and if I choose to work past that then it's a bonus but my decision. 

It may not seem like it now but you will overcome this and I believe that it will shift your mindset and change you for the better. 

Good luck out there!

Tech layoffs finally hit me,"Ops Manager, almost three years with my company. Currently in school part time & have a toddler. This is the first time that I’ve gone through a layoff.

My direct boss, who is on vacation at the moment, was scoping out my LinkedIn last night.

I have not touched my LinkedIn since getting the notification for several reasons.

But why the hell would he be looking at my LinkedIn? Was he expecting me to have a sad boi post? Or seeing if I was talking shit (career suicide)? Should I be worried in anyway?

Just felt weird and off putting. "
"New CFO hired consultants to ""help us"" -- is it over?","Hey guys we are owned by a private equity company and there have been numerous (rounds and stealth) layoffs since we got taken over. I always thought I was safe because my team is small. However, we just got a new CFO (previous CFO lasted <1 yr), and within his first week he told my boss he is bringing in consultants to help us with process road mapping, cost analysis, allocation, and other projects. These are all tasks technically our team could do, but clearly CFO doesn't think we are capable.

I feel devastated -37M,"I am ( or I thought I was) an accomplished scientist on paper - PhD, 30 publications, 2 postdocs with world leaders in their field, 5 patents and I was laid off on December by a pharma company in MA.

This is not what I wanted for them."
Tips from a former tech recruiter,"This is my first post on reddit. Hopefully it will be of benefit to someone\~

I worked 1 year as a contract recruiter at a FAANG in mid2000 in SV after grad school bc the pay was nearly 3x more than what I would've earned for my degree. After swearing off ever working in tech or recruiting again to travel and do other work, I spent another year in recruiting and experienced my first layoff right bf things went sideways in 2020. \[Edit: I don't have a ton of exp in this area, but since I didn't see any recruiters offering advice, I took to the time to share my experience. Take it for what it's worth.\]

&#x200B;

1. Applying for jobs. Remember for every job posting there are literally hundreds of ppl submitting their resumes for the same role. Don't take it as a personal failing of some sort if you do not hear back. And if ppl in your field or industry are getting laid off en masse, then there will be even more applicants per role. Not just in your locale but people from \*everywhere\* with similar work experience are all applying for that same job.
2. Tailor your resume. So many ppl. waste time writing cover letters. It's not the 90s anymore. Remember HR-recruiting is a low-IQ job in the corporate food chain. (Yes, yes, there are smart ones out there and they're usually superstars at their co., but majority are not that bright from my experience). So the first person whose attention you need to catch is this midwit. Customize your resume so that it mirrors the job description. Take out extraneous info. Don't post your hobbies, volunteer activities, etc. \[Edit: this is my exp for SV tech jobs, not non-profits or other fields\] Modify your past work titles to fit the position you're applying for \[Edit: I mean here to highlight your relevant exp as it pertains to the job description, not to lie.\]. Make your resume easy to read! Take out of the fluff. Make it so that a midwit can blink at your resume a couple times and think ""this person fits"".
3. Do not despair. Yes, you have every reason to despair. Believe me, I know the feeling of days, weeks, months blurring together to get a foothold back to some sort of normalcy while homelessness looms. But that despair will eventually manifest itself as nervousness/desperation during the interview process. Recruiters and potential employers will sense this and use it against you. So take care of yourself. Make a schedule. Treat your job hunting like a job you do a couple hours a day. Take this time to reassess, do things you didn't have time to do before. Whether it's volunteering, taking an online course, going to the gym, decluttering your house, etc. do something everyday to act as a counter-weight to the job search despair. What I see happen is that the longer someone is unemployed, the more resume s/he will send out even for jobs they're not a match for thinking resume blasting will make something happen. This is incorrect thinking and will amplify the job search despair.
4. Go outside. Really. Go outside and talk to people. Offer to walk a neighbors dog if you don't have a dog. You will meet lots of ppl. Go to meet-ups, free events, etc. This will help you feel less isolated and keep you mentally balanced. Exercise. Stop drinking. You will greatly improve your chances of getting work if you look good - that is, your skin, hair and body are in optimal condition. You will save money, look your best and improve your cognition if you stop drinking. Now you have all the time in the world, this is the best time to be your optimal self. \[Edit: This is not fluff. The fluff is in not doing it.\]
5. Re-evaluate. Yes, it sucks to drink tap water after nursing on that corporate teat for so long but remember, your time is more valuable than money. Spend this time to figure out what you really want to do. Not just in terms of happiness, but also how you can apply your skills and experience to new opportunities. If you spend all day thinking about how to get another job like the one you had, then your whole outlook for life and future is determined by this one thing and will lead to you despair the longer it doesn't happen. If money is tight, try doing work for smaller businesses, PT or freelance work. Consider doing work you normally wouldn't - at a bakery, greenhouse, lumber yard, Home Depot... The point is that new experiences can help you reframe and open your thinking. Regardless of the pay or position - the more you have a calm, positive attitude - the more you'll see opportunities. There is a reason why immigrants with little education can come to the US and do well financially. They see opportunities that Americans don't or are unable to because our entire education system has trained and conditioned us to work in an office cubicle.
6. Macro-economics. This downturn in tech, to me, is not unlike other technological transformations in the past. For example, there was a boom around railroad and railcar manufacturing from the late 1880s to the 1920s, then automobiles and assembly line production, which was replaced by more mechanization, globalization . .  telephone, telecomm... Many people had their livelihood destroyed during these transitions. Tech workers have been building the internet infrastructure, systems & web interface for 30+ years now. It's not a ""new"" industry anymore, so I think this wave of layoffs is part of a larger change in the social/cultural/technological landscape. I remember layoffs in the 80s and 90s US manufacturing jobs were sent overseas. Politicians were pushing the narrative that service jobs would fill the gap. It could be that corporations are planning to bring back manufacturing jobs while tech jobs are sent overseas. Neil Howe calls it The [Fourth Turning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory). Tech Lead calls it  [The End of Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l222fIkesAY). I don't know, but we're definitely in the middle of some transition.
7. Micro-economics. Cut your expenses. Don't eat out. Cook nutritious meals. \[Edit: Yes this sounds obvious, but from my exp. most Americans do not know how to even do this.\] If you can't afford your current home, consider moving to some place [cheaper in Mexico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYV_Os4z0Rw), etc. while you look for work, (use a US address for your job hunt tho.). If this is a prolonged downturn, you might have to move in with parents/family or merge households with friends. Be flexible, tenacious. There are lots of opportunities, you just have to be willing to think outside the box. \[Edit: During the 2008 downturn I met plenty of ppl who were laid off and were living in places like Guatemala and Thailand while they looked for work back in the US. Obviously less feasible if you have a family, etc. but ppl. were doing it so that's why I said Mexico as an example. Yes, this sounds like b.s. if you are reading this in Ohio, but believe me, it's not weird if you live in CA.
8. Examples. If you're considering a new career path such as a trade \[Edit: I saw some posts asking this so that's why this is here\] actually go out and get work as an apprentice/hourly worker first. There's definitely a need for reliable contractors but you also need to build up a referral network, have real exp under your belt, need liscening, insurance, etc. Are you willing to work in all weather outdoors? Can you fit into small dirty crawlspaces? If you're coming with tech background - there are many small businesses who still need a decent website. I know of ppl who do this using contacts overseas and make six figures building and support websites for small business. If you were to get a min wage job at a retail store and talk to customers with a positive attitude, you'll get insight on what lots of ppl need/want. I know a couple ppl. who were on Sharktank with basic products and earn a great living from that. Here's [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ashb7c/is_is_worth_giving_a_realtor_3_of_your_home_when/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on RE agent commission - if you read through the comments, you'll see there's an untapped market for P2P real estate sales. Lots of potential here.

When/if you find employment again, always devote some time to building a side business so that you're not blind-sided by a layoff. Always be your own boss.

Wishing everyone the best of luck.

Joining the rest of the troopers in the mass January tech layoffs,"I was laid off this morning in what I thought was a random call with my department’s SVP. There was absolutely no indication from my performance reviews or my manager and director that there was any issue with my performance and contributions at work so it just came as a total shock to me. 

I work remotely in a marketing position in tech, cybersecurity specifically, and have only been at this company for a little over 1.5 years. 

I know I can pick myself up but I think my brain is honestly just struggling to catch up to how I was so quickly terminated without any warning or issue within a 5 minute zoom call.

I know we’ll all be ok and I’m rooting for every single one of us. But man, no one can truly prepare you for how brutal, cold and quick this process can be. "
Layoffs are happening at tech firms that are doing just fine,"https://www.businessinsider.com/layoffs-happening-at-tech-firms-that-are-doing-just-fine-2024-2?amp

The biggest irony is that top managers are selling the DOWNSIZE TO GREATNESS mantra to Upper management."
The purge continues...,"I have been following closely the cases of layoffs that has been on the rise of late. I knew it wouldn't be too long until it came knocking. This subreddit prepared me for the worst, and honestly I was prepared. I don't Have any regrets whatsoever, I take it as a step in life. Yes I was in tech. I guess this will continue, and it will get better when it gets better 🙃"
I think the changes to tech are lasting,"I work as a software engineer and have for 15 years now. I live in a smaller state and have always worked for companies that make other core products than tech. When I first start developing the pay was good but it kept getting better and better. Honestly at this point most in tech make as much if not more than doctors w/ a better work life balance. I think the days of mega salaries is slowly going to fade. A big part of that is proving out working from home well worked which gave companies more confidence in moving operations overseas. Likewise ChatGPT makes it was easier to communicate w/ someone who doesn't speak your language. 

I think companies also have a way better grip on technology. When I first start we had analytics guy who really just read Google Analyitcs and maybe had read a few blog posts on improving your analytics. Now if you're in analytics you really need to be able to crunch which means SQL plus something like python. 

For things like websites and app I think companies have a better grip on what to develop. A lot of smal businesses realized we just need a Facebook or Instagram page. A lot of medium sized companies realized we just need a small basic website, our career section we can outsource. A lot of large companies realized they don't need an app. A lot of tech companies reverted to their core competencies killing other apps, websites and services in the process. 

To me all of this says the gold rush is over. If you were engineer in the early 1900s and know how combustion engines worked you were probably a very rare breed. Compare that to now where we have millions of engineers w/ advanced understanding of the internal combustion engine. That's where we are w/ tech. We're going to become more like ""normal"" engineers in our salaries and job prospects."
Laid Off from FAANG,"This is just a quick vent about the industry and my career path. I was laid off during the first wave of cuts in late 2022 from a FAANG company. 

I worked my ass off to get in and was genuinely enjoying the work and project my team was supporting. I was only in the role for 10 months before my entire product / business unit was dissolved.

I had just bought a house and I’m the sole provider for my family; I didn’t have the luxury of taking time off or waiting for the next best fit.

Now I work at a mediocre job making peanuts and reporting to a clueless boss. The role feels like a huge step back in my career and I don’t even get to reap the benefits of having FAANG on my resume because I wasn’t there for 1 year before getting burnt. Now I feel stuck in my current job because I’ll look like a job hopper if I leave too soon. I’m experiencing severe skill decay and frankly just feel like I’m living in someone else’s sick dream everyday.

I recognize that I am fortunate to even have a job in this market, but damn I am still bitter about the position I’m in after pouring so much time and effort into perfecting my craft and having the rug pulled out from underneath me."
What the hell happened,"Years ago a company laid off workers when business conditions demanded it. Long before then the press had revealed the companies dire straights. 

Today we have corporations announcing billions of dollars in profit. And in the same press release announcing layoffs.  An unconscionable  juxtaposition. 

As economic systems go, I’m a capitalist. Unions have seemed on  the other side.  It’s starting to look like something is needed on the employees side. 

It’s crystal clear nothing and no one is on the employees. Govt sure the hell isn’t. When did things become so twisted against the American worker?

What’s the answer?

Should there be:
A) no change?
B) Union’s
C) Something else?   Ideas?

Which do you think?"

Went to the doctor.. came back to work with a doctor’s note and still got terminated..,Worked at amazon for 2 years. The amount of hours i put in that job is modern day slavery. I didn’t have time to cover my absence but I thought I would at least get unpaid unexcused time because of my doctors note but they seem to not care. I was throwing up and forcing myself to be around people that sick just seemed disgusting and selfish. Regardless of me being fired I still feel like i did the right thing. I do have money to survive on but I’m a 24 year old with no family so I do get worried but hopefully I’ll get okay. I worked hard to get out of homelessness so I’m really trying to prevent that. I should also add that the job market is terrible right about now. I shouldn’t have relied on Amazon … i guess I’ll use this time to actually find a good career.

Layoffs are temporary, don’t beat yourself up. Recognize that it’s a chance to reset and come back better.

Why am I getting so many emails about outsourcing my US team and shifting to an AI business model?,"I don't even care about being downvoted. Most of my close friends are unemployed, I barely bring in any new projects to my business, things are getting cheaper, and even houses are sitting in the market longer than before. Wtf is happening? I work in PR, and I've never seen anything like this. I've had random consultants and freelancers blow up my LinkedIn messages begging for work. I've also had reporters that I've worked with on client stories reach out to me for freelance gigs. Unfortunately, I can't even offer them a job because I've had to cut costs everywhere in my business. 

The weird part about all of this is that I continue to get emails about shifting my business to an AI model and outsourcing my teams to countries outside the US. Is any new business or entrepreneur experiencing this as well? Why is this not being reported?

Are US tech workers of 2024 the new factory workers of 1980?,"I'm not involved in tech at all - but the fall of any industry impacts all, and I've been watching what has been happening since 2022 to try and prepare myself for any impact.

I live in an area that used to have a large amount of manufacturing and dealt with the aftershocks of mills and factories closing and transferring manufacturing overseas - a decrease in property value, an increase in poverty, and entire towns shutting down almost overnight.

with more and more companies choosing to lay off domestic tech workers in favor of hiring workers overseas, leading to similar products (again, I'm not in the industry, so I can't speak to the actual nuts-and-bolts) and an increase in profit due to decreased overhead, is this actually going to turn around? or is this the new normal?

Manufacturing at least had to account for import and shipping costs of internationally made products. the internet and the success of remote work has shown that tech work can be performed worldwide, with almost instantaneous results.

I guess as an outsider, I'm looking for ya'll who know to tell me I'm wrong. what parts of the tech chain are mandatory to be performed domestically? is there any sort of financial benefit to large companies to keep US jobs?

I just really want to be wrong.

&#x200B;

*update:*

thank you all for your insights- i've learned a lot! 

I agree that for some aspects, and for history- factory work might not be a perfect example. but i was trying to make a connection to mass industry changes due to economic changes and industry advancements - not a 1 for 1 comparison. But i understand how it was misinterpreted. my bad. 

I also agree that industry downsizing is a HUGE aspect to the current climate. Companies expanded in 2020 - was it to accommodate all the new work they were doing? was it to have staff in place for future projects? was it to make shareholders feel that the company was growing? 

if the third is true - maybe when the market shifted, and interest rates made the extra salaries less justifiable, these same companies ""cut the fat""- keeping a product that the average consumer sees no changes in, while increasing the profit margin.  - if this is the case, I worry that these positions are gone for good. 

again- my knowledge of the tech sector is limited, but in the 2000 tech bubble, did the companies that laid folks off have increases in stock price? 

the only thing i really remember about the 2000 tech crash is that pet website with the dog puppet and the funny superbowl commercials. and how that company isn't around anymore. 

I miss that puppet. "
Sorry...Just venting,"I got laid off (2 months back) from FANG after working there for 2 years. My job was going good until a new manager came and decided to push me out.

I know 2 months is not a lot of time but I am in my mid 40's with 20 years of IT experience and MBA from a prestigious university.

It just hurts to get rejected after working hard for so many years."

"What exactly will happen to all these workers, especially in tech?","Apologies if this is a stupid question, I was only 12 in 2008 so I don’t really remember the specifics of what happened during our last really bad job market (and no, I’m not trying to say today’s job market is as bad as 2008). Also things have changed significantly with tech so I feel this question is valid

But if significant layoffs continue, especially in tech, what is supposed to happen to a large pool of unemployed people who are specialized for specific jobs but the supply of jobs just isn’t there? The main reason for all of this seems to be companies trying to correct over hiring while also dealing with high interest rates…Will the solution be that these companies will expand again back to the size that allows most laid off folks to get jobs again? Will there be a need for the founding of new companies to create this supply of new jobs? Is the reality that tech will never be as big as the demand for jobs in the way it was in the past, especially with the huge push for STEM education/careers in the past couple of decades?

Basically what I’m asking is, will the tech industry and others impacted by huge layoffs ever correct themselves to where supply of jobs meets demand of jobs or will the job force need to correct itself and look for work in totally different fields/non-tech roles? Seems like most political discussions about “job creation” refer to minimum wage and trade jobs, not corporate"
Contemplating 401K Withdrawal,"As a software engineer who has been unemployed for nearly a year, I am struggling to make ends meet. With few job opportunities on the horizon, I am considering using my 401K savings to cover my expenses. Unfortunately, I cannot think of any other viable options. While I would prefer not to deplete my savings, I am unsure of what else to do. I am reaching out to others who have been laid off to see how they are coping with the financial challenges posed by the current economy."
I have absolutely no value,"The economy is bad, tech layoffs are accelerating and everyday I go to LinkedIn it feels like World War III. Just last week thousands of people were laid off at Cash App, Square (Block), Flexport, Discord etc.

I'm a senior product designer and I probably applied for hundreds of positions.

Last week I had a quick chat with one of my old coworkers and she reminded me that 2024 is going to be a really tough year for all of us. She's contemplating to temporarily move out of San Francisco to save money. We all need to save now.

At this point I've been contemplating if I should do something else. And I quickly realized that I pretty much add little value to society because there's nothing else I can do besides being a great product designer. Yea, I could do UBER, deliver food, work in retail be a server. I don't want to sound privilege but at the same time if you've been making 6 figures for almost your entire career it's hard to go back to make $20/hour.  I definitely will do so if I start cutting a lot into my savings.

The company was in New York, but my boss and the other member of the team were in Colorado.

The rest of the details are boring, new ""turnaround"" CEO, multiple rounds of layoffs, I just got cut yesterday morning right before going on vacation with my family.

And damn things look impossible right now. I know, I've felt it, I was looking while employed just not at the level I'm about to. Luckily that means I have a resume and Linkedin ready...but with those so far I haven't landed much. 

My family and friends tell me to be hopeful, that this could be a good thing and I might work my way into another job or lifestyle I actually enjoy. I dunno, ya'll seem fucking miserable - and I don't feel like I'm especially niche'd in a specific industry beyond content (newsletters, podcast, video) web-dev and SaaS. This last job was at a multimedia company...is that even product management at that point?

For now I'm just going to get that battle sheet done, get this music education website and consulting website up, and make listings.

Here’s the simple matter at hand .. (layoffs in tech),"Long time lurker on this sub but offering a different view on the economy with layoffs..

From 2020-2022, we lived in unprecedented times. The money thrown at workers was absolutely insane, especially in the tech industry. Outside of friends I know, the stories of tech workers making 500K to work 2 hours a day (and post it on social media nonetheless) along with insane offers/signing bonuses thrown out there was never sustainable. That wasn’t real. In addition, most organizations over hired and did a horrible job forecasting the economy. They overhired due to competition over hiring and expectation that projects will be prioritized as such. Many of these became obsolete. We’re going through an inflection point in many industries (looking at you tech) where they are trying to right size their organization or carefully step into different fields to explore (AI). This obviously along with making borrowing money more expensive is fueling these mass reductions in force. 

I also think Elon played a part as the tipping point. He’s done poorly with X in management but his drastic change in reducing headcount led to short term wins in the bottom line. Now, other tech orgs followed suit. They don’t need entire departments focused on the same product or idea. Not saying this was the sole reason but a catalyst nonetheless to increase operating profit and keep SG&A low. 

My two cents .."

I also met all the required items listed on the description. The items listed as ""preferred"" were specific vendor software titles of which probably a dozen exist. I have experience in other software that performs similar functions.

At the 6th or 7th question of the interview, I am asked, ""do you have any experience with these specific software titles?""

I replied that I examined the KBs/documentation and that it is functionally similar to what I do now using other software titles. But no, not these specific software titles from this specific vendor.

The recruiter went on to state that ""we provide NO training here and we are looking for someone who knows exactly what to do in this position upon starting without any guidance or instruction.""

I agreed that it wasn't a good fit and we ended the call together. But when did ""preferred skills"" now become mandatory skills with no training provided whatsoever? Is that where we are now with employment, offering no training? And is it commonplace for employers to ignore commutable skills and look for only candidates that have vendor-specific experience?"
Lol @ 1% merit increase ,"Work at a publicly traded tech company. Had my end of year review, it’s was rushed and extremely vague with no specific examples of recognition, positive or negative feedback or areas for improvement. I was given the second to lowest possible score. Again, no reasoning why was given. Nothing specific at all. The doc is pretty lengthy as there are questions manager must fill out. No tangible areas to work on, no feedback, very weird. On top of that, the funniest part to me was my 1% merit increase. Lowest increase I’ve received in my career. Literally 1%. Imo that is worst than no increase at all. I find it to be a slap in the face. I also take this as the writing on the wall, they want me gone and are laying the groundwork. 

I challenged the scoring and methodology and was immediately gaslit. “Most people will have a similar score.” “You are doing a good job.” If I’m doing a good job then why am I at the bottom? It’s a leadership and managerial failure. I have biweekly 1:1 and was never told I was not meeting expectations or falling behind in any way. 

That is all. Just wanted to share. 😄😄

*Update*
Thanks for everyone’s own personal anecdotes and experiences around going through something similar. I know corporations across the board are slippery and cannot be trusted. This is nothing new. I’ll point out, my company did a pretty large layoff over the summer where ~22% of the company was let go. Then dozens of new positions were posted for overseas. There are still dozens of positions open for overseas. Company is changing some operating models within the organization and part of me at least feels like more layoffs are on the horizon and these low scores and merit increases are the groundwork for those.

For those of you who were laid off - did you see it coming? Or were you blindsided?,"I was blindsided by layoffs this week. 

My company was doing well. And we were BUSY. It’s not like the work was dwindling and we had to find things to do. We had a huge backlog of implementation that we needed to accomplish. I felt safe and secure in my role because I figured if they did issue layoffs, how could they possibly get all the work done? 

Well to my surprise, they decided to layoff 10% of staff today. I am in literal shock. 

Were any of you in the same boat?"

Trauma from layoffs,"Hi everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster on this subreddit. I was laid off 3 times from 2020-2024 in the U.S. There were multiple reasons for the layoffs: pandemic, tech recession, org restructuring. I was wondering if there's such a thing as developing psychological trauma from going through layoffs? I was fortunate to have found employment after getting laid off multiple times after some time. But each time I entered a new job after a layoff, I can't help but feel like I'm about to get laid off soon due to unforeseen and uncontrollable circumstances. Like it's become a reaction for me at this point.

What is your trauma going through multiple layoffs? How has it affected your employment after you found a new job? And if there is a way, how did you overcome this trauma? "

Layoff shocker-- model employee let go,"So I know some of us have had moments of wondering if something we said or did put us on the layoff list. Did someone think we were a problem in some way?

I have even seen people who did work I admired get let go,  but later on found out there was some sort of hr issue or controversy or contract conflict.

But today I found out a former co-worker got hit. I worked with her at two different companies.

This lady was the perfect employee. Kind, friendly, helpful, good at her job, versatile. She obtained a certification that made her even more versatile and valuable.

I did not work at her most recent job, so.I don't know everything, but I doubt her salary was out of line or she was making really good money. Just a model employee that everyone liked a lot.

So don't waste too much energy wondering if someone put you on the layoff list for a shortcoming.

Got Laid off last Friday from a big tech company,"I got told verbally two weeks ago that I needed to fix some technical things that were not really part of my job description. I thought I did fix what needed to get fixed since otherwise I loved that job despite my terrible at communicating art director.  
Last Friday got told it was my last day then, due to poor performance, but I would still more than two months worth of severance.   


So which one was it? If I got fired why did I get severance, if I got laid off why would I be the only one? I'm really sad, not sure what to do anymore...."
Unemployment is the breeding ground for conspiracy theories,"The more I read many posts and comments here, the more I realize how true the proverb “an idle hand is the devil workshop” is. 

Yes, unemployment is tough. But not only is it true that the internet is not a real place, but constantly being on a layoff subreddit makes this look even worse than they are. 

I’ve seen some wild theories on this subreddit. The constantly beaten drums always seem to be -  the government is hiding something and of course immigrants; both legal and illegal. 

Here’s the fact; while times are tough and there’s definitely less hiring due to companies overhiring during the pandemic, there are people still getting jobs everyday. They just aren’t posting on r/Layoffs.

I just want to move on but feel so much anger from being laid off,"First corporate job, I was 3 months away from getting all of my vested stock, they decided to do a mass lay off.

I just want to move on but at the same time all I can feel is the desire to hurt those people."
One month notice for layoffs,"
*update* I was laid off along with 7 others on my team, including my director and VP. Was a rough two weeks with layoffs daily. In a way it’s a relief that it’s over. 

My company announced a 6% reduction in the global workforce, ~550 jobs. We haven’t been informed of the roles/areas that will be cut, only that the US layoffs will begin at the end of March, meaning we all have to wait to see if we will still have jobs or not. 

I experienced several layoffs at my previous company, but i was never laid off. I used to think a one month warning was a nice gesture, but the anticipation is slowly eating away at myself and my team members. 

Wanted to post a few of the warning signs from this layoff/other layoffs I’ve experienced:

- new leadership team/CEO 
- low operating margins/profit
- consulting groups 
- high debt, even if the company has high revenue 
- buzzwords “streamline, efficiency, cutting out bureaucracy, doing more with less” 
- budget cuts, including hiring freeze (a good indicator of whether or not your role is “essential” is if your company is posting jobs in your area)

AI is coming for us all.,"Well, I’ve seen lots of people post here about companies that are doing well, yet laying workers off by the hundreds or thousands. What is happening is very simple, AI is being integrated into the efficiency models of these companies which in turn identify scores of unnecessary jobs/positions, the company then follows the AI model and will fire the employees.. 

It is the just the beginning, most jobs today won’t exist 10-15 years from now. If AI sees workers as unnecessary in good times, during any kind of recession it’ll be amplified. What happens to the people when companies can make billions with few or no workers? The world is changing right in front of our eyes, and boomers thinking this is like the internet or Industrial Revolution couldn’t be more wrong, AI is an entirely different beast."
CNBC reports on laid off techies,
"Laid off, got offered a lower salary for a new job, should I accept?","Laid off in December last year, was making 135k. After 3 months of job hunting, got offered 2 jobs and both offer 120k. Should I accept it or keep looking? Most of the positions I have interviewed so far offer 110-130k. I feel like market is so bad right now that I should not wait for a job that offers the same compensation and just accept what I have been offered.

Edit: Thanks everyone for taking the time to read the post and share your insights. Had no idea my post would blow up like this. Just a little background, I’m 33, live in a HCOL area and bought a house last year, so all of my expenses were budgeted around my 135k salary. I understand that 135k to 120k is not a big drop like many of you highlighted but the drop still hurts especially when you’re an immigrant and your entire family relies on you. At the same time I’m grateful that I have not one but two offers and can continue supporting my family."
My first layoff - I’m a mess/questions,"My whole org was laid off last week (financial services company - take a wild guess who) and I am at a loss. This was my first job after school, the reason I moved across country, etc. I shaped my whole life around it. I’m young and I don’t know what makes me competitive in tech research these days? Or if I can pivot to a different domain? It seems like no one will take a gamble on anyone. My friends at other tech companies have been laid off 6+ months with no luck. Idk what to do but I’m freaking out. 

My severance is peanuts but I haven’t signed anything. Any tips for negotiating severance? Can you? How should I go about it? Ugh."
I got laid off yesterday. I am happy as can be,"I have been in my industry for over 20 years, and through some pretty painful experiences early in my career I learned to read the spurious signs early, and make decisions based on them.

I was let go yesterday, one of many at the company, and my boss told me ""you're the easy one, because I know you've been preparing already"".

Now, I don't presume everyone is privy to the information necessary to judge the state of the company, but over the years I have found that if you show interest, you will get the information, often through unofficial channels (if the company is big, Blind is a good resource too).

I dunno, I felt like posting a positive layoff post after reading all these dire ones. Layoffs suck, but they can also be a new beginning."

"Just learning about ageism by recruiters, and “botox your resume”, and it’s blowing my mind ","I’d especially like to hear from current or former recruiters and hiring managers on this topic (besides your personal experience), so we can learn from the other side of the table 

While reading some discussions in this community, I am just learning recruiters are discriminating against people with multiple decades of experience, so called “ageism”.. is that true? until today, I had been thinking deep and broad experience is an asset, and that I lack enough of it, based on insane number of skills listed by recruiters in many of the positions I’m interested in. I’ve been applying for the past 8 months to data scientist jobs

One of the suggestions to reduce such a bias is by botoxing one’s résumé. Apparently botoxing is about NOT showing your vast experience, removing the dates of your graduation, and even omitting some years of work experience, so recruiters don’t think you are one of those “too old” people. does that help?

Here is my question: I just can’t understand why they would discriminate against more experienced people with a proven track record?  only thing that I can think of is the additional cost for the company in terms of salary and compensation for the senior more experienced employees demand. What are the other reasons?

It’s possible this happens only in some industries and not others.. what are they? 

TLDR:
- if ageism exists in hiring, why?
- what industries does it affect?
- other than botoxing, what else can we do to mitigate it?

Ps: when I google “how to Botox your resume”, most of the top results are from 2013. Kinda weird - something must have happened then prompting Forbes and BBC to write about this."

Tech Layoffs Suck,"I joined this group shortly after finding out I would be laid off and debated if I would share anything. I hoped to share my story and seek advice on processing and dealing with the emotions that come with this. 

I've been with my company for six years, and oddly enough, my Anniversary was just celebrated on December 11th. I started at this company when I turned 18, and I'm now 24. I worked my way through the ranks as an agent, and after about four years, I was promoted and relocated from Kalispell, Montana, to Denver, Colorado. They had me working in corporate, closely with executives. I grew into a Project Management role, leading global initiatives, software deployments, AI deployments, etc. I've always gotten great quarterly performance reviews and positive feedback from my teammates, coworkers, and our clients. 

My company, being in the Tech Sector, has been doing layoffs for well over a year now, like most other companies within the sector. After surviving the bloodbath that was in 2023, I thought the doom and gloom was behind me, and I stayed to fight another day. After returning to work from my end-of-year Holiday break, my boss scheduled a surprise meeting and informed me that “due to economic conditions, and blah blah blah” (my brain shut down the moment I realized what was happening), I was going to be laid off. They gave me four weeks advance notice to either find a new position in the company or I'd have to leave. 

After searching for four weeks, I wasn't able to secure anything. It felt like a slap in the face, but they offered me an Operations position that would have been a demotion and a $30k pay cut. There was no way I could accept that. Budgets are as tight as possible, with departments being asked to cut costs more. They seem to be preparing to do more layoffs soon and couldn't justify keeping me in any department within corporate.

Last Friday, February 2nd, was my final day at the company. Today, I mailed back all of my computer equipment, and now I'm left to figure out what's next. This came as a huge shock. I was naive to assume they wouldn't let me go, especially after spending thousands to have my pack up and move my life to another state for them. I now understand the shareholders come first. 

To keep moving forward and not get stuck in depression, I have a part-time job now that gets me out of the house, and in good news, Colorado allows you to collect full unemployment benefits while working part-time. 

I was also given six weeks of severance for my six years of employment (which felt like another slap in the face), which will help me stay afloat. I’m unsure if this is normal, but they tied my severance to unemployment, so I only get it once I qualify. (You’d think after six years there, they wouldn’t make getting severance so tricky)

This has been a lot of emotions to process. It’s hard to process being let go on a layoff when you didn’t do anything wrong. I gave them my life, and they threw me away like garbage.

Somedays, I feel ok, and other days, I’m depressed. Somedays, I feel confident that I’ll overcome this obstacle, and on others, I feel worthless, like my dignity has been stolen. 

I know these are normal emotions, but what were some healthy ways you processed them? How did you overcome the obstacle of being laid off? Any advice or personal stories help. I appreciate having this group; it definitely makes me feel less alone. 

If you read this far, thank you. I hope I was ranting too much and shared a cohesive story."

I Get My Letter Tomorrow,"My tech company is downsizing physical locations. Tomorrow I receive my letter asking me to move 700 miles away. If I choose not to move, I will get laid off sometime between April 2024 - 1QTR25. 

I enjoy my job and make decent money, but I don’t want to uproot my family. The tech industry is in a scary place though, and I’ve read so many horror stories about finding new work. Since my company is offering to let me keep my job I wonder if I should take it. It’s a tough decision. 

I’m the head of household, but we live frugally and will be able to survive on my significant other’s (SO) income alone. My SO is willing to move, but doesn’t support the move for this reason because from their point of view the job stresses me out at an unhealthy level. My company also has never ending layoffs - this is the 6th time since 2016 I’ve had a target on my back for a layoff. Was able to survive the others, but don’t think I will this one. I’ve had co-workers move in previous years and get laid off a few weeks later.  

Would you move to keep your job?

Two people from HR (the person who actually laid me off and the recruiter who found me) have both asked to connect again. Their pictures have the #hiring banner. It feels hurtful and dense of them to do this. How would you feel?
Just laid off and it just hit me haven’t been able to sleep in weeks ,"I worked for a tech start up in a data/ technical support combo role 

I loved it!  I was exposed to so much that I didn’t encounter in my previous roles(consulting/help desk) and despite the pay I really felt like I could make a difference and I wanted to stay. (How foolish)

I learned about new technologies and met some intelligent and wonderful people 

My managers were receptive and transparent 

It felt good…until it didn’t. I KNEW there were going to be lay offs, every sign was present, so I tried to prepare, remained grounded and positive for others but today I’m just engulfed in so much fear and anxiety. 

I was fine until I saw the premiums for cobra and the gov health insurance. What the fuck! 

I managed to save a bit and we received a decent severance (3 months) but I’m freaking out. I’m an early 30s female poc (just for descriptive purposes) and I don’t know what to do. I feel leagues behind everyone else. 

I’ve been grinding on the applications, tailoring my resume and networking, it seems to be producing some leads but with all the news of FAANG layoffs, and all the younger grads vying for positions how am I supposed to get another position being average. I went to an average school, served in the military but there are millions like me. My clearance expired. My sister who has a masters and graduated from a top university it took almost a year for her to find something luckily she has a partner.

I can’t think, I’m constantly freaking out and I can’t sleep. I am not above applying to labor jobs or CNA work, I’ve done them before but every one of those has 100s of applicants too. Just to continue to work and keep up.

How do you handle this? Not to mention the anniversary death of my son is coming up. Work kept me grounded, and my mind working. Now I don’t know what to do."
Freshly laid off,"I (25/F) was just laid off from a company I had been with for almost 2 years. I was a Corporate Recruiter and loved it, I honestly saw myself there for the rest of my career. I was just laid off this morning for the very first time. I am not angry but more so really sad about not being able to be apart of this company anymore. Can anyone tell me what is normal to feel and what to expect? After the call, I haven’t heard from my manager, have no clue what to do next with my current projects, etc. I have two options: I can have my last day be this Friday and take my full severance, or I can work on a “special project” that would allow me to take my full severance but have my last day be Feb 29th and still get paid normally until then. However, if I do that, I couldn’t start a new job until March first without “leaving voluntarily” during the project and losing all severance. I just don’t know what is normal to feel emotionally, process, etc. Does anyone have any advice?"
What is happening everywhere ?,"All i see is layoffs everywhere including the US and my home country India. I am not from the US and live in India and the tech and the startup industry here (in India) has just crumbled and there are massive layoffs and hiring freeze everywhere. If the US economy is underperforming, it affects everyone else in the world especially tech. I have been laid off and it's been almost a month but all i get is silence from the hiring managers. Jobs are posted and when you apply rarely anyone calls  back. This is going to be long and hard winter ❄⛄ for me. Apologize for the rant."
"Laid Off, Lost, and Scared","Last Monday, I was laid off two weeks shy of my 1 year anniversary at that job. I'll be 45 this year and I'm terrified about my prospects. I never had any good mentoring or parenting, so I wandered aimlessly from job to job, industry to industry for 15 years after high school. I attended community college when I was 19 but never finished. Finally, in 2012, I followed a passion into a career in the beverage industry and excelled quickly. Within 5 years I had a dream job with a high salary and creative control. I was flying high, winning awards and gaining notoriety. But after several years of bad work experiences, burnout, and lack of growth/opportunity, I left it all behind and returned to corporate America because an old coworker of mine offered me the job and said he'd never earned more and worked less. I gave up my career where I was barely earning but was trusted and respected. I left for the prospect of earning a high income for my wife and kids. Turns out it was a bit of a fly-by-night company and they finally laid a bunch of us off last week. It was a toxic, family-owned cubicle farm full of nepo-babies that was destroying me from the inside out. Making a career change is hard enough, but my boss was also abusive and I rejoined therapy as a result. At one point I thought I needed to be hospitalized.

This office gig had a weak base salary but I was getting bonuses/commission, and the earning potential was seemingly unlimited. Everything slowed down a few months ago and I've been paycheck to paycheck ever since. Now there's no paycheck at all. This has seriously strained my marriage, which is approaching its 20th anniversary this summer. I don't want to return to the beverage industry (I don't even drink anymore and don't want to be around it) and every job I look at online just looks like another prison. I'm so utterly lost - I don't know what to do with myself or how to proceed. I need to get back to work ASAP or we're in serious financial trouble. I've sunk deep into depression. I'd already been applying for months since work started slowing down, and I've only had one interview 2 months ago. I had 2 friends at this one company give me glowing recommendations, I was told my interview went well, and I got rejected anyway. I know it's only been a week and I've been applying to jobs, but I'm terrified at how long this might last, and if it has the potential to break up my marriage or cost us this home. I'm completely directionless and don't know what to do.

Thanks for reading."
"As an engineering manager, I've been laid off 3 times in 18 months. Now researching and experimenting with non-traditional ways to make money and writing a book about it.","Like most people I've been inundated with IG ads about how to make money online and have decided to take 3 months or so to try them out. Has anyone tried any of these types of ""ways to make money"" like Amazon FBA, daytrading, affiliate marketing, etc?

I've always thought of software engineering and even engineering management as a safe way to fund the lifestyle I want to live but no longer think it is as safe as it used to be. I'm not in love with the profession like I once was and think there are better ways to live life when you open your mind to more non-traditional ways to making a living. Am I being stupid?

PIP or Severance ,I was just handed a PIP after completing a large 8 month long project.  I manage a team of 4 and the company laid of 2 team members without giving me any say in the matter 6 weeks ago.   My PIP states among other things that I need to rebuild the moral of the team. I need to do a better job anticipating the metrics needed by managers amongst other unusual and highly subjective claims.  I was told that I had 24 hours to sign or take 2 months severance.  I was also told that the company thinks the PIP is the better offer.  90 percent I will take severance and walk.  Brutal environment. Any ideas? 
Was asked to train my replacement. Have four weeks to go. Need advice.,"I was asked to train my replacement. I’m being let go and was asked to stay on longer to train my replacement. This doesn’t sit well with me because:
1. I was told they needed someone with more advanced skills. But, I am having to teach him basic skills in the tool we use. 
2. It’s frustrating handing over and being asked questions like I am in charge, because I understand the system more. And the tool that we use as well.
3. I wish I had negotiated for a shorter training time. I was ill advised by my recruiting agent to wait it out. But I do have money saved and now I see that my hunch to leave as early as possible was correct. 
I wish I could leave today and can’t see myself working for the company ever again.
Would love advice on this. 


Update:
Thanks so much guys… I so appreciate all your advice… I’ll cut my stay short to a week, do my best and head out.

Lesson learned… "
Need advice. Laid off and they want me back. ,"I was laid off earlier this week and I got a call today that they want me back. My manager pretty much fought with upper management to get me back which I appreciated. 

I still haven’t signed the severance agreement and they offered 3 months severance including earned pto. 

They mentioned something about me being a contractor if I come back. I don’t know anything about working as a contractor and this is my first lay off experience. I have no clue what I should do that would protect my best interest. 

It’s a big company and I had been working there for almost 4 years. My ending pay rate was a little over $70/hr. Would appreciate some tips from the veterans here. Thank you. 

Edit: man you guys are awesome! Getting some good advice here. To others who have been laid off, keep your head up and we will all get through it. "
Lost hope as a new grad. I hate this feeling. ,"Hi everyone. I graduated from my undergrad degree in December 2023. I have been job hunting since November 2023. I know people in this thread have been job hunting for longer.

I feel like I did everything I was supposed to. Went to a great school. Got a great degree and good grades. Impressive internships. All for nothing.

My parents spent so much money and time for my university. I have probably submitted more than 200 apps at this point, and have gotten maybe 2 or 3 callbacks. I’m 21 and I’m losing hope. This is not how I expected my career life to begin.

I struggle to keep my emotions together. I cry randomly and get angry often. It’s like I open my laptop and there’s another rejection email. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I failed myself and my family. I know people have gotten laid off for worse and could have it worse than me. But I just feel horrible and don’t have a direction. How do I deal with this?

Edit: I know 200+ apps isn’t a lot. I mentioned that in some comment replies here. Apologies, I should’ve made it clearer. I know the road ahead is hard, if anyone has gone through it, I just want your advice. 

Edit 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1bfp41r/new\_grad\_pick\_at\_my\_resume/](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1bfp41r/new_grad_pick_at_my_resume/)  --> Posted my resume if anyone wants to have a good time to roast me. Or lend me their expertise/referrals. I will be very grateful.  

Edit 3: Some of you are commenting as if I was dumb to not get hired before graduation or something of the like. I had a full time offer a month before graduation - got indefinitely delayed due to a hiring freeze - so feels like I got laid off before I even got a chance. And hence these feelings. Now my usual industries (tech and consulting) are a shit show. Just wanted to give more context. "
is anyone actually excited about being layed off?,"I'm sitting here part way into my 90 day working notice with 3 months severance after that, plenty of emergency buffer (a year+), and a few first and second round interviews scheduled over the next few weeks. My manager has acknowledged that he doesn't expect me to be working 100% leading up to my separation so I'm doing 10-15 hour weeks. I was starting to hate my old company but was too lazy/nervous about leaving to search for something new. I think this is just what I needed to move onto new and better things. Life is good!"
My job says they fired me to avoid UI benefits.,"I just found out today that fact-finding wants me to clarify why I was fired. I was laid off, along with a bunch of other people. What am I supposed to put under “Why were you fired?”?!?! 

I feel so betrayed. I cared so much for that company, now they stab me in the back."
Do you think these mass layoffs will have an affect ?," 

The widespread layoffs have impacted many of us , both economically and emotionally. However, what has been particularly worrying is the way these events have been politicized and down played. I believe people really don't want think about far-reaching consequences these layoffs may bring.

The United States has long been advertised as a land of opportunity, yet what often goes unmentioned is it's intensely competitive and demanding work culture. Having spent the majority of my life in Europe, I've observed that the work-life balance in the U.S. falls significantly short when compared to most developed nations. [https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/work-life-balance/](https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/work-life-balance/)

While high salaries once compensated for these drawbacks, recent trends indicate a shift towards lower compensation, which seems shortsighted. Employees brought on under these conditions are more likely to depart the moment a better opportunity arises, leaving companies to face the costs of rehiring and retraining. 

If things gets worse, I can see a scenario where the combined issues of job insecurity, a volatile job market, insufficient opportunities, poor work-life balance, and declining salaries will no longer be attractive for those living in the U.S. or for attracting talent from abroad. Even if things get slightly better the memory of these mass layoffs and their impact on thousands of families will not be easily forgotten. For instance I am sure some of us working in tech are starting to reconsider whether we want our children to enter a field that's prone to job cuts. 

In their pursuit of short-term profits and shareholder satisfaction, corporate leaders may unwittingly be sowing the seeds of future challenges. These problems, if left unaddressed, could become significantly more costly to fix in the long run.

I may be exaggerating it a bit but what do you think ? Do you think it'll get better ? worse ?"
I just spent the night in tears. I don’t know how much longer I can do this (vent),"I’ve been trying to find strength and motivation from this group by reading similar stories to mine, but there’s one thing that always sticks out to me. It’s been six months since my layoff and I haven’t had ONE interview despite sending out over a hundred applications. 

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m only applying to positions where I meet most (85%+) if not all of the qualifications and still hear nothing. I’m only 30 years old but have a wealth of experience in my field as an IT product/project manager and yet, I’m getting nothing but crickets. 

My old boss actively scouted me for my previous role since he and I worked together at a previous company. I should have seen the writing on the wall when on my very first day they were layoffs. I was only there a year despite doing great work and making a lasting impact. 

Fast forward to now. I’ve cleaned up my resume, paid to have it reviewed by a recruiter for feedback, include a cover letter and a glowing recommendation letter in every application. Since the inception of my career after graduating college in 2015 I’ve never had trouble finding a job. I’ve leaned on my network as much as I can, but at this point it almost feels like begging. 

I’ve never felt more demoralized in my life. I need to break my lease and move back in with my parents because I just can’t keep making rent payments anymore. Im the daughter of blue collar immigrant parents. I feel like a total failure for how long it has taken me to bounce back, and how much I continue to slide down into worse and worse circumstances.  

Is there something I’m doing wrong? Folks that are getting call backs, what is your method? Are you applying to things you’re overqualified for? Any help or words would be much appreciated.

Edit: thanks for the kind words of support! To clarify, I can see how my previous wording was confusing to some. 

I’ve sent something like 600 apps since getting laid off after taking a mental health break for the first two months. My layoffs happened at the very end of July, ahead of a lot of other companies so it came as a total shock to me and I needed the time. Not to mention my previous boss actively scouted me for the role and begged for me to join the team. Saying it caught me off guard was an understatement. 

I said “over a hundred” because to me that alone was a wild number. In the past I’ve sent maybe 10 applications tops before i landed a job, let alone an interview. But i know now that’s not a common experience and my expectations were probably off from the start. 

But I’m at a point now where I’ll start switching it up and applying to government jobs, smaller companies, etc just to get out of this rut. 

EDIT 2:

I got a job!! Happy to report I didn’t have to take a pay cut or take a more junior role and it’s with a MUCH better company. Thanks again to everyone that took time to share words of encouragement."
I was shocked when a recruiter told me I was too old for another tech job. But now I'm fighting back ageism,"   Story by  T. Paradis

* *Vern Six shared his encounter with age discrimination after a recruiter questioned his tech career.*
* *Following a viral post about his experience, Six started a LinkedIn group to fight* [*ageism*](https://www.businessinsider.com/barbara-corcoran-said-older-workers-should-act-younger-in-interviews-2024-1)*.*
* *He would like to work in tech again while building his fundraising company, Purpose Brew Coffee.*

*This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Vern Six, 58, who has worked in tech for over three decades. After getting laid off from a contract job, he updated his LinkedIn profile to indicate he was open to work. A recruiter contacted him and expressed surprise at how long Six had been in tech. Six, who lives near Waco, Texas, with his wife, posted about his experience with what he saw as* [*ageism*](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-can-older-workers-prove-ageism-and-age-bias-in-hiring-2022-11)*. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.*

*I've been in tech as a developer, a senior engineer, principal software engineer — whatever you want to call it — for 37 years. My career has ranged from three-month to four-year engagements. I'm almost always hired as an* [*independent contractor*](https://www.businessinsider.com/gig-work-apps-tech-work-want-full-time-role-2024-2)*.*

*After I got laid off, I got a phone call from a recruiter, which happens a lot. He said, ""Hey, I've got your résumé. Can you spare a few minutes?"" I said, ""Sure.""*

*So, he went to pull up my LinkedIn profile. He goes, ""Oh, wow, you've been doing this for a long time."" It was like he'd never read my résumé, which was 12 pages long and listed every project I ever had.*

*Then he goes, ""With 37 years in this business, I'm surprised you're not a CTO."" He said, ""That's going to be a hard sell. I don't even know if I can pitch you to any of my clients. They're all going to wonder why you're not a CTO or at the C-level."" I was like, ""Did you just say that?""*

*I think I responded to him in a way my mom would not necessarily be very proud of. Then I hung up. He was really hateful.*

*After my* [*post on LinkedIn about his call went viral*](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vernsix_im-stunned-just-had-a-recruiter-inform-activity-7167946832742928385-DzTQ?utm_medium=member_desktop&utm_source=share)*, he begged me to take it down and not be naming and shaming. I probably have no less than 200 emails from attorneys wanting to represent me to go after this guy. But I'm just like, ""I don't need to be a part of him getting bad karma, and I don't need it to possibly come back on me with some bad karma. It's just not who I am.""*

*Other people have also come out of the woodwork. I have more than 73,000 emails in my inbox. In the ones I've gone through, I've gotten, I don't know, 100 invites to date. I've been married for 25 years, so I'm good.*

*I've had probably 200 hate messages. They're like, ""Just go away, you old goat,"" and stuff like that. Other people have used some very explicit language.*

*The post had over 2 million impressions on LinkedIn, and I've had thousands of connection requests pop up. People wanted me to start a group there, so I created one called* [*Inclusive Futures*](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14418151/) *to fight* [*ageism and discrimination*](https://www.businessinsider.com/cost-of-inequity-age-discrimination-could-cost-economy-trillions-2021-6?utm_campaign=2021-q2-special_projects&utm_content=coi&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter)*. It already has over 400 members.*

## 'Bring the old guy in here.'

*I didn't see any ageism at my last company. But, before that, I'd seen it. ""Bring the old guy in here. See what he has to say about this."" I can't tell you how many times I've heard that since I was 45-plus. On one hand, it's kind of flattering in that, OK, my opinion is valued. On the other hand, it's damn insulting.*

*It was most prevalent when I was working as a software engineer. At many social events, I was simply excluded. In other cases, it wasn't the right type of event for me. I'm not going to go to an axe-throwing bar in downtown Dallas. They would go play paintball. I'm an old Army sergeant; I can play paintball, but I'm 58 years old. I have broken my back a couple of times, and I'm not exactly going to do those things anymore. If they want to go out on my bass boat and we go fishing — let's go.*

*But in my experience, over 37 years, women have gotten a much worse run over the coals than what occurs with ageism. I've heard hundreds of people comment about women in tech — which can be career-ending discussions — and they're just talking lackadaisically in the middle of the boardroom or cubicle or whatever. Discrimination, in general, just kind of pisses me off.*

## Going for coffee

*This is the first time in my career that I've ever had more than 24 hours that I have not been employed somewhere. I'd been on this work project for four years. I've always been an independent contractor; I've had a great career. I have been building web apps mostly for the last 26 years. And I'm a former CTO.*

*My wife and I recently bought more than 30 acres next to us. We went to the closing at 3 p.m., and at 4:20, I received a phone call from my client that my contract work was being suspended because they'd had a problem at the company. I was just like, ""Holy smokes. I just made myself cash-poor and don't have an income.""*

*We're former full-time missionaries. Before that, we had been kind of serial entrepreneurs. We owned a chain of indoor amusement parks. We sold that, went and lived in Guatemala, helped build an orphanage, and financed all of that through the sale of the amusement center business and my tech work. I've worked wherever I can plug in my computer. I've been in 92 countries and earned an income in every one of them.*

*In 2021, a friend and I were discussing how we could really make an impact in the world. So, my wife and I started this fundraising company called* [*Purpose Brew Coffee*](https://purposebrewcoffee.com/)*. We wanted to focus on helping projects raise money. The basic model is that we white-label our coffees. And we create a website — because I'm a tech guy, right? — and brand our coffees for the organization doing the fundraising. They promote it to their supporters, and we ship the coffee to the customer.*

*The seller of the coffee earns a percentage for each bag sold. It's a huge share. Thirty percent of the retail dollar goes to each organization. If you sell popcorn, cookie dough, or chocolate bars, they often get at most 2% to 4%.*

*So when the layoff happened, my wife and I looked at each other and said, ""Well, maybe it's just time."" Then she said, ""Nobody can do our tech better than you. Let's stop paying the contractors and have you take over."" So we went down that path. We've doubled the number of partnerships — just in the last few weeks — because I'm doing it full-time now.*

*But even though I love the coffee business, I am still looking for another tech role. After the LinkedIn post, I've been getting a couple hundred calls a day from recruiters. I would take a project that lasted from a few months to a few years. But, for now, the coffee business is growing. It's going to be a cool, cool deal. I think it's really going to take off. It will not support us at the moment. We're living off of savings. But within two months or so, I think the business will support us.*

With so many Layoffs how can the Media Claim the Economy is Good?,"The mainstream media keeps claiming the economy is great. 

Yet I'm seeing so many Layoffs here. 

How can they keep claiming this?"
Anyone else feeling like a slave after layoffs?,"I got laid off in april and cant find a job, my days are spent studying for interviews, interviewing or talking to recruiters.  My sleep schedule is screwed due to having interviews from anytime from 7am-2am and often having to cram for a last minute interview.

Each company has 4-6 interview rounds after the initial screening call with a recruiter and Ive interviewed with over 40 companies so far without an offer. Some of the companies had take home test that took days to complete, told me it was the best they received and then rejected me for getting nervous in the live coding round or having a slightly different design than they were expecting in the system design round.

1 company I interviewed with for 6 weeks and 5 interviews turned out to have lied about raising money so they couldnt even offer a job if they wanted to.

Its a ton of work, for no money.  I didnt even get unemployment because my states portal locked my account and I couldnt get in contact with anyone until they eventually sent me a letter saying Im no longer eligible"
How long have you been searching? Anyone else frustrated by this economy?,"I've been unemployed for about a month, but looking for half a year. Just overall rejections and no call-backs. Getting frustrated, and sad about the economy. What the heck is going on? Is it me? Or is it just a bad job market right now?"
The Real Unemployment is 8% and Rising!,"
The real unemployment rate is 8.0%, the highest since 2021. The number idiot politicians talk about doesn’t cover all of people looking for work, only a fraction of them."
Is this a “quiet layoff”?,"A friend that works at a startup in California told me they received a very negative performance review. The feedback was very brief, and their manager was not able to give examples in person, or even in writing. They felt blindsided and it does not line up with how they thought things were going. They are relatively new to the Co & thinks there is pressure to cut costs heading into next year.

Is this a pattern that others have noticed or been through? Are there situations where a company or managers cannot directly tell employees that there is pressure to cut costs? Are there advantages for the company to hiding that as long as possible?

CA is at will employment, & maybe there’s disclosure tripwires that would scare investors or talent, but that feels like too speculative…"
"US economy adds stunning 353,000 jobs in January - really?",[https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/jobs-report-january-02-02-24/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/jobs-report-january-02-02-24/index.html)
PTSD from a layoff 15 years ago,"It was my first job out of college. I started in 2007 and one day in December 2008 my manager called me to his office. All he said was ""due to business situation your position is eliminated"". I was lucky enough to find a new job with comparable pay and job function within 30 days, but I think I am still haunted by the layoff until today.

Ever since that layoff in 2008, I never stayed with one employer for long. Every time I get a new job, I stay for about 2 years then I started feeling unstable / unsafe. Usually around this time a recruiter or new opportunity pops up and naturally I jump on it. I am working for my 8th employer now and the longest one I stayed was 3.5 years. The reason for that long was getting 401K vested (3 years service 100% vest, or 0%). 

Because I never stayed with a single employer for enough time, I never get a promotion. I do get promotion in title and pay from going to another employer, but I think it is probably not good for my career if I switch jobs too frequently. 

During my career I have seen many people stay with one company for 10, 20 or even 30 years. For me 5 years seem too long because I am always afraid about getting let go. Do I worry too much?"
How do you process your emotions when you get laid off?,"I’m really struggling with handling and coping with my emotions after getting laid off.
I feel so much anger and hatred for how I was set up, treated unfairly, and basically replaced by someone who is getting paid less. I feel like the severance they’re giving me is just to silence me. A lot of people I worked with are just as shocked as I am and it hurts.

First time I’ve ever experienced this in my life. How do you take care of yourself during this time? How do you not let the anger consume you? How do you move forward into a positive mindset?

If anything, I’m really trying to fight not getting bitter from my experience. But I do feel like I’ll have a hard time being myself or feeling safe at a job again."
I'm feeling so lost and demoralized and tired,"I was laid off in October of 2023, I'd worked at a small company for three years and in that time taken on responsibility after responsibility. Just prior to getting laid off I'd run my whole department alone as people were out for vacation. 

I've been job hunting since the moment the news hit me. I don't know how many applications I've put out, I've sat through rounds and rounds of interviews. I've been ghosted, talked down to, had my hopes raised and dashed. I thought it was hard job hunting three years ago but this market is absolutely insane. 

I just want this to be over, I just want a job in the field that I'd worked so hard to get into. At this point I don't even care if I make as much as before...I've never had a job search go on for this long. How can they possibly say that we're not in an economic recession? "
"Hey, I finally joined you!",Got the call 20 minutes ago after 20+ years. It's a relief in a way but I have to get working again soon. I'm 60 so that should be easy.
Appropriate amount of savings for layoff?,"I am sure I will get laid off this week. Currently a mid-30’s Sr. Engineer at around $175k. Rent is around $2,500 and have no additional expenses other than usual (utilities, insurance, gas, health club, etc).

Suspected layoff,"Software developer working for a small company. Two months ago I got my year end review and I got a do not meet expectations after 5 years of excellent reviews. I asked why I got the bad review and COO told me I am too expensive and they can’t afford me. I’ve been talking online courses and interviewing a little.

I’ve been at this job for about 1.5 years and don’t have that much communication with my boss (who is remote across the country). 

He randomly emailed me and scheduled a 1:1 Meeting for tomorrow with minimal information. We’ve never done this before. The only time we’ve done formal meetings is for performance reviews, which haven’t happened yet for this past year. 

How worried should I be? My anxiety is through the roof. I have a horrible, ominous feeling about this."

"My mother’s favorite You Tube girl was furloughed , she cares more about her than me lol.","Back story : I was laid off in April of 2023 from a  FAANG . Over 500 applications and 3 interviews. My mother ( secure boomer with home and retirement ) has been supportive of me but has looked at me a few times like I am not trying hard enough to find work. 

Now my 74 year old mom follows a number of young women who are savers , off grid dwellers , bakers etc…well one young woman ( saver , very smart high level environmental employee ) posted about being furloughed. It was heartbreaking and gut wrenching ( she made me watch it) . I really felt for her . She was so thankful she had been saving to payoff her student loans but held on to the cash . She’s been furloughed for 3 months in MA. with zero pay. Again , I relived my own layoff watching …it’s sucks so bad . 

But then am looking at my mom , like duh mom …been trying to tell  you the economy is going to shit for white collar educated workers but I am sorry it hurt someone so close to you . HAHA

Anyway ..I think she finally sees every industry is shaving workforce , taking cost saving measures , and torching the lives of millions of people.

Got let go after 2.25 years of good performance and promotions…because the new CEO “it’s just business”,"I am in the semiconductor/MEMS field. I am good at what I do. This is in Cali.

I started as a staff engineer 2.25 years ago.  I have 20+ years experience and I work hard, am dedicated, and try to do the right thing. Promoted to senior engineering manager in 6 months, and then transferred and promoted to director of process engineering after being a manager for 6months, my track record and effectiveness working in different teams is evident.

I was volun-told to go to a different group (process) to fix it. We were well on our way and the team was gelling. We went from being the bottle neck to moving smoothly and in a cadence. As an example, We were able to increase tool uptime and decreased Dr/scrap by >50%, in about 4 months. This included setting up a system to do this.

Now that this group is doing well and I have demonstrated myself successful and good enough to get promoted, I now make too much coin (their decision, I didn’t ask to be transferred and promoted, didn’t want the director position), and I’m no longer useful, apparently.

They wouldn’t let me go back to my previous position either, so…

New ceo and owner of company took over 6 months ago. They laid off my vp of Eng who was tasked to solve the problem and thought I was a good fit there, and then shortly thereafter, they let me go. Without his protection, I was in a foreign group where the team loved working with me, but I was now a target by the old boy’s club. 

Saw the writing on the wall, but didn’t want to believe it. After all, our team was one of the highest performing… then I was let go one day after showing up to work without any warning.

I’m very upset about this. Mad, cuz we were turning it around. Sad, cuz we work too hard and are a good team, but mostly disappointed because the team gets a bad rep for underperforming, but it’s the leadership that is causing this. I guess the silver lining is that this may be a good way to jump ship before it is done sinking.

Thanks for taking the time... Severance was a joke, no final 2 weeks pay, just cut off and walked out the day of.

I know we are an at will state, so they could let me go for most anything, but this just seems wrong. Anything to put this in perspective is much appreciated. Thanks a bunch."
Layed Off during Maternity Leave,"What a shitty thing. I’m having a hard time adjusting to being a mother and taking care of my baby. On top of that, I get the news that I got laid off with the severance being mere peanuts. I contacted an employment lawyer and seems like everything was legal. I feel very broken right now. It has been so hard to process and I feel like it came out of nowhere even though there were signs. I feel blindsided and feeling very down about myself. I feel worthless. I also feel like a shitty mother because I don’t know how to help my baby sometimes. I hope I’ve already hit my rock bottom but I know it’s going to be hard out there to find another job."

I have had companies show lots of interest only to come back in a day with a rejection. I am getting to a point where I can’t imagine going through any more interviews. I am physically unable to do it any more. My brain does not let me go through another 8 rounds of reiterating the same stories and scenarios multiple time only to be tokd “everything was good, but we think we can find someone who has 2 more years in XYZ, so sorry, it is a no”. I still need to pay the rent and bills though. I want to get an hourly job and not have to think about it for a month at least. Has anyone done that? Is there a light at the end of this?"
"After layoffs, new director told team this…","The team’s original director got let go, and the team (along with many others) got put under another director.  When asked for any uplifting words about the latest round of layoffs, the new director told the team to essentially cherish their time at the company because they get to work on things that everyone uses, whereas they’ll probably be working at some no-name boring place in the future of their careers. 

I’m stunned that this was the message to the “survivors”… what would you make of this??

Paranoid of layoffs,"I was laid off in 2019 but used it as a motivator to build my career. It was an entry level job after college. At the time I was on my mom’s health plan and I have a wide skillset. I’ve been grateful to have grown since I got laid off and have been a top performer in my future roles after. Sometimes, I can’t help but get paranoid about future layoffs.  I’ve adopted a mentality of always to be open to hearing about opportunities while still building healthy connections and killing it in my current role. Any thoughts?"
Well I’m joining the club. Sort of.,"I got the dreaded spontaneous meeting invite after our morning stand up. 

I was told that my role is being offshored to India. So they gave me two options, either move to India (the conditions of which are incredibly unattractive and practically hostile) or make the ’decision’ to leave. 

They’re doing this to avoid paying me a proper redundancy payout. And yes, I am in contact with a lawyer before I sign anything. 

This is my first time being laid off, and my god does it suck. I spent the day taking stock of my life, realizing how I was practically killing myself to get that promise of a promotion and a salary increase and it was all for nothing. 

I’ve let my health go to shit, I’ve forgotten my dreams and hobbies and I have lost touch with so many friends. 

I know that this is the time to find myself again, but I have a problem. I’m living in another country in one of the most expensive cities in the world, London, and have maybe 3 months of expenses available. 

I can either go back to my home country and convert my savings into a pretty decent chunk of cash, which I don’t really want to do because I’m not done with Europe yet, or I can pray that I somehow land a position in the month between now and my last day. 

I have no social circle to lean on or put me up rent free for a couple of months. I have nothing but a laptop, some clothes, two guitars and a motorbike. 

Of course my parents want me to go back, but it feels like such a massive backwards leap. 

I’m sure there’s a third option, but I can’t see it yet."
How is a 40 year old college degree relevant for a 15+ years of experience senior level position. ,"I’m talking the IT job sector. How is it relevant?

Laid off and immediately converted to contractor,"Pretty much what the title says. I was a director at a small firm I helped get off the ground 4 years ago. We lost a key client recently and as a result the CEO laid me off.  He then immediately - literally in the same conversation - offered me 10 hours a week of work as a contractor at 2x my hourly rate but with a very limited scope of work. That was 2 weeks ago. 

The first week he gave me 16 hours of work, all of it outside our agreed scope. This week, I worked 21 hours — only 2 hours spent on projects within my contract scope.

For example he asked me to negotiate and then sign a contract with a new vendor on behalf of the company. (How is that acceptable when I’m not even an employee anymore?)

So, I’m basically doing the same exact job I was doing as a salaried director but w/o benefits or insurance. 

Is there some sort of claim I can bring against him?

What industries are most job secure?,"Hi all - I am a senior level graphic/UX/web designer. Last summer 2023 I was laid off from a Fortune 100 insurance and quickly took a new designer role at a smaller company in the fashion/e-commerce space. I knew going into it that the job was not a good fit for me, but the pay was comparable and my family relies on my job for health insurance so it was a calculated risk. Since being hired the new company laid off 12% of the company around Christmas time and I skated by, but I have a feeling I won’t be able to skate by forever. 

I am currently applying externally and would like to know - what industries are the most secure or stable long term? Should I consider taking on a new career path outside of corporate designer roles? 

It’s sooo unbelievably frustrating that even as a high performer you can’t guarantee that you’ll stay long term at any one place if you get caught in a reduction in force. The corporate job market is so so frustrating atm.

Happy Layoff Story,"A lot of people are stressed about current or upcoming layoffs for good reasons.  Maybe a happy story would be good?

My dad was laid off at 56 after 35 years at his company. He had two kids in college.  Everyone at his office were called into one of two rooms. When he got to his room it was announced that everyone in that room was being let go.

Rather than a gold watch for 35 years of service, security met him at his desk with a box where he could pack up his personal items. He knew it was coming so had already grabbed his personal stuff and contact information (it was before LinkedIn). Security kindly escorted him to the parking lot.

He decided to start his own consulting company.  At one point, his old company hired him back as a consultant at almost twice his old salary.   He got to do what he wanted and pick his own jobs. After a few years of this he told me, ""I wish they had laid me off years ago!""

Good vibes please 🙏,"I was laid off from a marketing agency right before this past Thanksgiving (and my birthday 😭). I’ve stopped counting how many applications I’ve submitted as it’s probably somewhere between 400-600 and I’ve done ok with interviews, I probably had 20-30 in Dec and Jan, although some of those were ‘chats’ with recruiters that went nowhere and some were HR phone screens that weren’t much more than them confirming my resume details were correct and wanting to know why I want to work for the company, etc. 

This community here on Reddit has been comforting during this time as I took the layoff quite personally but I now know that I’m not alone and there’s likely nothing I could have done to prevent it. 

That said, I’m at the point now with two potential employers where I think I might get an offer from one, maybe both companies. I’ve completed a total of 7 interviews between both companies and now is the time where I sit and wait and let others determine my fate. 

My wife has been supportive through the process but is kinda over it now and checks out when I start to tell her about any given day’s interview activity and Ive kept the initial layoff from most friends and family, so I’m counting on you, yes YOU, to send some good vibes my way so I can get a dang offer already and get back to work!

Update: your good vibes worked! I ended up getting two offers on Monday and I signed one today! Thank you all for the kind words, I was blown away by the support and positivity on this thread 🙏"
"eBay to slash about 1,000 roles, or approximately 9% of full-time employees"," 

Team, 

We are on a path to building a stronger eBay for the future — one that is growing, and resilient in the face of any challenge. Over the past three years, we made fundamental changes in our experiences across categories and accelerated the pace of innovation at eBay. In areas where we’re investing, we are seeing consistent increases in customer satisfaction and a meaningful improvement in our growth relative to the market. 

Our strategy is the right one, but there is more we can do to ensure our success. We need to better organize our teams for speed — allowing us to be more nimble, bring like-work together, and help us make decisions more quickly. Today, I am sharing news about changes we are implementing to better position eBay for long-term, sustainable growth. 

The most significant and toughest of these decisions is to reduce our current workforce by approximately 1,000 roles or an estimated 9% of full-time employees. Additionally, we plan to scale back the number of contracts we have within our alternate workforce over the coming months. These are not actions we take lightly — and we recognize the impact they will have on all eBayers. We have to say goodbye to people who have made so many important contributions to the eBay community and culture, and this isn’t easy. 

### The Need for Change 

Despite facing external pressures, like the challenging macroeconomic environment, we know we can be better with the factors we control. While we are making progress against our strategy, our overall headcount and expenses have outpaced the growth of our business. To address this, we're implementing organizational changes that align and consolidate certain teams to improve the end-to-end experience, and better meet the needs of our customers around the world.  

### Next Steps 

Shortly, we will begin notifying those employees whose roles have been eliminated and entering into a consultation process in areas where required. Leaders will communicate the news directly via Zoom, and your VP or eLT member will send an email once the notifications in their group have been completed. 

We request that all U.S. employees work from home on January 24th to provide some space and privacy for these conversations. We’re committed to treating everyone with respect and empathy through this transition and providing impacted employees with support and resources.    

### Looking Ahead

These changes are difficult, but I’m confident that by working together we will become stronger than ever. In the months ahead, you will see a more focused, agile, and responsive eBay — one that is better positioned to advance our purpose of creating economic opportunity for all.  

Thank you,    
Jamie "

I DONT DO ANYTHING AT MY JOB. FEAR I WILL BE LAID OFF SOON.,"   
Seven months into my new job, I've yet to tackle the work I was hired for, and the promised projects haven't materialized. Instead, I've been assisting other departments with unrelated tasks. Concerns about potential layoffs due to cost-cutting add to my frustration. I don't understand why they hired me if they had no work lined up for me to do. My financial plan for this year was to pay off a 35k car loan. But if I do that, I will be left with maybe 3 months' worth of safety savings. I fear that I will need the money in the event I am laid off. However, paying off the debt will also mean lest bills to worry about if I don't have a job. WHat would you do? "
I'll probably be laid off at the end of the month - advice,"I work for a company that has offices in Europe, so they had to send an email about ""reductions"" that leaked to the US offices.  Upper management confirmed they'll be making an announcement at the end of the month.

However, I just found out that he will still be contracting for the team for the next few months (this is being kept a secret).  This puts me and another guy (who makes less than me and has been here longer) in the crosshairs.

80% worse off. we need our jobs back.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/80-american-households-worse-financial-202857254.html
Companies are posting fake jobs?,"Anyone have any thoughts or experiences with this?

"Business Insider Layoffs: 8% of staff or 1,000 employees","Another round of layoffs incoming for Business Insider. That’s 1,000 families that will have difficult nights ahead. God speed. 

https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/01/25/business-insider-layoffs/72351587007/"
A person who is laid off needs just one positive thing to happen to them,"As soon as you are laidoff, everything seems negative. Not only do you lose your job, but you also lose your colleagues and friends, your support system that includes healthcare and insurance. It also feels like you have been thrown to the wolves, to fend for yourself in this harsh job market. It's as if you're cast adrift, struggling to navigate an unforgiving job market, while facing rejection after rejection, often through no fault of your own. It's a time when negativity seems to cloud every aspect of life, leading us to lose hope and feel isolated. I know that is how I felt.

And I realize that the only thing that helped me snap out of it, was a few positive things that happened to me. A kind gesture from a friend, a helpful tip from a former colleague, or guidance from someone who'd also faced a layoff. These small positive things, no matter how small, were like lifelines, helping me to find my footing again.

This experience made me realize the importance of even the smallest act of support or kindness during such tough times.

One of the positive things I have started doing is to work on [https://laidoff.support](https://laidoff.support) . It is not much, but something positive has helped me during these uncertain times. Every week is a rollercoaster; some weeks, I don't hear back from interviewers. I hope it brings you the same positivity it brought me. It is just a list of resources to help you get through a layoff and meet someone from the community and have one positive thing happen to you every day to help you to keep moving forward."
"Is it just me, or has the job market been unusually quiet lately","Is it just me, or has the job market been unusually quiet lately ? Since the beginning of this year, I've hardly received any calls from recruiters, and I haven't heard back from most of the jobs I've applied to, except for rejection emails. It's been about four months since I've been unemployed, and I'm starting to feel really discouraged :(

For your references, I am looking for data scientist, data analyst positions, have a master degree and about 3 years of experiences. I had applied for about 10-20 jobs per day. "
going to a dark mental space,"I was laid of in July and am still unemployed. I've applied, I've edited my resume, I've written cover letters, I've updated linkedin and my portfolio. I keep getting rejected. 

At first I turned my fear and anger inward and told myself it was me, I was flawed. I know that made my friends uncomfortable. Now I'm turning my anger out, towards the system, and that's making my friends uncomfortable as well. Everyone says they're supportive, but I know it can't be easy being sympathetic to a person for 8 months straight. I feel like I can't talk to my friends about my emotions around this anymore because they're just tired of it, and I don't blame them. My mom is tired of it, so is my sister. My boyfriend keeps asking what he can do and there's nothing. 

I'm starting to go to a place mentally that I know is dangerous. The place where I just push everyone away because I think they'll be better without me. It's not a good place. I've been there before. But I genuinely think my friends are tired of me. I'M tired of me, I don't know how they couldn't be. 

I don't think I'm looking for advice. I know my therapist would say to do the opposite of what my brain is telling me to do, but I'm afraid of permanently damaging my relationships with my current mental status. I feel like I just need to stop talking to people for a while. Until I get a job and am mentally stable again. 

Has anyone else felt this way?"
"I hear about fake tech jobs, or fluff jobs, or pointless jobs......Was your job real? For those tekkies who can't find work, What exactly was your previous tech job?","I hear about fake tech jobs, or fluff jobs, or pointless jobs......Was your job real?    

I want specifics.  What exactly did you do at your last job?  Language used, type of project, new dev, maintenance of legacy, was your code live, project mgr, etc?   

&#x200B;

What happened to your role?  Is someone else doing it now, or does the project no longer exist?   What exactly were you doing, and what has the job search been like?"
"Failed the final round interview with CTO and his comment to my recruiter was ""I'm too confident""","Hi All,

I recently went through 4 rounds of interview and the CTO decided not to make an offer. His comment was ""I'm too confident"". I and my recruiter are baffled about the response and not sure how to process it. If anybody has any tips on how to fix it then I'm all ears.

Update 1: Thanks for the overwhelming responses from this community. I'm trying to response to each comment as much as I can.

Anyway, I added the context of the situation below so we can get details out of the way.

Title: Senior System Administrator / Cloud Engineer
Compensation: $135k base + benefits + 20% bonus if goals are met

Location: Houston, TX

Company: Large oil and gas company

I did a self reflection about where things went wrong. The question was ""this role is leading multiple teams, and you're the subject matter expert for Management. At any time, you will need to be available and ready to take over. Are you capable of that?""

My answer ""Yes, but I would take a different approach instead of being the only person knowing in and out of the IT Infrastructure. I'd promote the strong documentation system, where Sys Admins can cover for each other if someone went on vacation or having sickness. Additional, I'm a strong believer in team work so I would implement a buddy system, where a senior member would paired up with junior member on the same tasks. That way, the juniors can learn while the seniors supervising the progress. By doing this, we as a team will have opportunities to build relationships and grow further together.""

Conclusion: should have just say yes, I'm available anytime, and anywhere 24/7 for the business. I have 3 other interviews this and next week as well. Thanks for the kind words 🙏

Edit 2: I just accepted a job offer this morning as an AWS Cloud Engineer in New York. Thanks everyone 🙏"

This is the hardest day I have had in weeks,"I have really had a lot of good days and experiences since being laid off. But today was just hard, I was sobbing as my husband left for work. I've not \*\*had\*\* to find a job in a long time, one just flowed out of the other. Having to worry about the end of my severance is hard. I have two side hustles, one is having a good month, the other is brand new and requires a lot of new technical skills and I get frustrated. I really have to decide whether I want to pursue my old line of work or branch out or just focus on maxing the side hustles. Applying for jobs is so different now too, SIGH. Today just sucked."
Unemployment Rate under 4% for 2 years. Best 2 year stretch since Richard Nixon,"(https://edition.cnn.com/business/live-news/jobs-report-january-02-02-24/h_058919e0a1e82e533554cf04681b8d11)

""The job market is hotter than the Last Dab. The US economy added 350,000 jobs in January—about double what economists had expected. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, meaning it’s been below 4% for two years and, according to CNN, you’d have to go back to when President Nixon was in office to see it stay that low for that long. While that’s good news for working Americans and job seekers, it probably means Jerome Powell and Co. won’t be in any rush to cut interest rates since it doesn’t appear the economy is cooling down."""
"I got laid off last Friday ,without formal communication #layoff","Hi i got laid off 9th Feb at 6pm
It was a quick 10 mins physical call between HR and reporting manager, and they said it's not based on performance as i had good rating all years ,it's just because of cost cutting they didn't mention last day anything,
Next day manager msgs me saying i need handover and pls give me laptop also 

I don't have any formal mail or anything from company , they are not willing to give and asking employees to resign in system 
Need some guidance as what to do"

I know people across all fields, retail, healthcare, IT, manufacturing, sales, manual labor (electrician, HVAC, plumbing and construction) I don’t know a single person who’s gotten laid off yet and whenever I talk with them they say business is busy. For example, I was the gym the other day with my friend who is an electrician, he told me it’s so busy in the industrial/commercials electrician field right now that they can’t hire enough guys. I know most of us here don’t do manual Labor but the fact that COMMERCIAL work is so busy for these guys has me scratching my head because I thought business is slowing across the board? I also have a few friends who told me about the plane tickets they recently purchased for their summer vacations. I just really don’t know what’s going on. Is it possible the north east just had a strong labor market? "
Laid off within a year,"Learned a valuable lesson last week.

I left a stable, great job for a smaller company in my industry who gave me 100% pay hike and relocation to a good country.

In just one year, they have laid me off. I’m going through a period of regret where I should have just stuck to my previous job (which was literally in my dream company).

I asked for this, and now I’m suffering the consequences."
Are most layoffs in tech or are tech  people just a vocal minority in here?,Seeing a lot of post regarding tech layoffs but not much discussion around other fields 
Am I really crazy to not want to go back to working at a corporate job after layoff?,"I am a financial analyst for a tech company. It was a decent job when i first joined back in 2019, my manager was really good and the company was doing well. I really enjoyed my team of colleagues who I became good friends with. 

The past 6 months has been really tough for me, we got acquired by a competitor, because the company wasn't doing too hot due to the high interest rates.

I got assigned a new manager who is crazy and constantly threatens to fire people if they do one thing that isnt to his liking. The new company is also doing rolling layoffs of  employees that got acquired. My HR friend told me privately that I'm on the list for the next round. 

I feel pretty disillusioned after the acquisition. I think if I am laid off, I may not want to go back to working at another corporate job.

I am not a super materialistic person, so I dont have a ton of debt or expenses.  I also don't really care about the ""prestige"" (whatever that even means anymore) of climbing the corporate ladder. 

I feel like society has defined selling your life to a corporation to please your boss, so you will be rewarded with a made up ""title"" to make your ego a little bigger and a paycheck that you need to give to the bank to pay back your debt is what every successful person does.

I've done this for awhile now, and I think I want to give up. Everyone I talk to is telling me I'm crazy for thinking this way? 

Some people have called me stupid and even got really angry when i questioned what the point is of doing any of this. 

Am I really crazy?

I don't mind collecting unemployment until I figure myself out. Im pretty thrifty and manage to pay off my debt in the past couple years. I live with a few friends and I'm content with the things I have.

I travel when I can, I try to treat people right, I have done some cool things outside of work and met some unique people. I realized these are stuff that makes me happy and make me a more interesting person. Consumerism in contrast doesn't bring me the same level of fulfillment and almost feels as a way to cover up the deeper causes unhappiness. Like taking Tylenol for a headache without solving the actual issue."
The worst year for me (2023),"This probably was the second worst year for me (2018 being the first when I met 2 successive road accidents and was almost about to die). Getting laid off and not getting any responses from recruiters has made me miserable and angry. There is not much joy and i am just hoping some form of employment will come up. I thought wfh option was here to stay and will be the future of employment  but it seems the corporate overlords and management cannot do without controlling employees. Add to this 2 ongoing successive wars in Middle East and europe and the AI monster about to come for many tech and software jobs, I doubt the coming year is going to be all that different. I don't want to sound all doom and gloom but things just not have been the same for past couple of months. Something has changed and not for the betterment of employees. The LinkedIn easy apply is almost a joke, by the time the job is posted, almost hundreds have applied 😖. Recruiters don't even respond to cover letters. (I am from India and i understand many of you are based in USA, so things might be different at your end). Thanks for listening to the rant and may the force be with you !"

January Fed Data Shows That Both Layoff and Quit Rates Remain Low,"For anyone who is a nerd and follows this stuff like me, the January JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary) data dropped recently from BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics). This survey is where the Fed gets its data regarding movement of labor, ie quits/layoffs/hiring/postings. The BLS remains our best source for data that is labor-market related and this survey is quite important. Without further ado: 

BLS JOLTS report for January is here: https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm
BLS Layoff numbers: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSLDL
BLS Quit Rate: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSQUR
BLS Hires Rate: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSHIL

My take on the data, for what it’s worth: 
- Hiring rate is consistent with a higher unemployment rate, but remains consistently higher than separations. Businesses need employees! Labor force participation continues to rise to meet this, which is great news. 
- Given our low unemployment of 3.7%, a job separations rate of 3.4% is quite low. Means people are staying at their firms and firms are reluctant to let people go. 
- Layoff rate remains consistently low, nothing has changed much, and layoffs are super low by historical standards. "
With layoffs in 150k range just YTD - shouldn't brand new guest workers (65k+20k) put on hold?,"Title says most of it - we just have a huge pool of talent with so many tech layoffs this year, why adding brand new 90k H1b engineers in the mix.

(note - there are about 95k new H1b issued every year!, renewals are not in counting)

Edit (3/1) - thank you for insights. Just to clarify, the point is about policy and not people. Just like companies do surge in hiring and scale back as market situations change, I was curious if there is a case for govt also do have such market tied flexibility."

What’s your plan for surviving the unprecedented layoffs?,"I worked in big tech and was doing really well. I had two back-to-back “exceeds expectations” ratings, and I was working long hours towards getting a promotion. I was working on some cool projects and felt like I was making a difference. 

Then I got laid off.  

I was bitter and angry, but I am the sole bread winner for two households, so knew I had to get over it because the longer I dwelled on it, the more time I’d waste, especially given the amount of people that had been laid off. So, I immediately doubled down and applied for jobs, but after about 100 job applications I only had 2 interviews and no offers. For context, I used to apply for maybe a handful of jobs at A list companies and get and get offers from a couple and then be done in 4-6 weeks. 

I’ve lost complete faith in the system and the idea that if you work hard you’ll be valued. It’s also become very clear to me that the job market for tech has never been this bad, and I think things are going to get a whole lot worse as AI takes our jobs (yes it will, don’t believe the bullshit that people who learn AI will keep their jobs - we’re all expendable so some billionaire can make another billion dollars at the expense of our livelihoods and our ability to provide for our families). 

So my plan is to take back control of my destiny and become financially independent. I’ve been working on a startup idea so that I can have more control of my destiny. It sucks that I have to dip into my life savings to survive right now, but the way I figure it is that if I am able to establish a business of my own business I’ll be able to work beyond retirement age and make up the loss. I may have to get a job in the short term to cover my cost of living, but I’ll treat it as a side hustle, because I intend to remain focused on building my business. One thing is for sure, I’ll will never sacrifice my personal time for any job again, and any job I get, will just be a paycheck.  

How has being laid off affected your perspective on working for corporations? What’s your plan for surviving this era of layoffs that we are in?"

My question to you all - if put in a similar situation, which you relocate (on the companies dime) to safe your job.  Or hang tight and let them lay you off?"
Very good week,"For the first time since getting my layoff notice mid-November and my last day end of December, I had a busy week with both interviews and recruiters/staffing agencies reaching out. Will likely have 2 more interviews next week, giving me a total of 5 this month. Although layoffs are still going on all over, it seems like employers are also opening up budgets and creating a lot of reqs. One caveat however, is that these are all hybrid roles that I’m in the process with, which have a significantly less applicant pool vs. fully remote roles.

Anyone still looking for a job 1 year after layoff?,I'm an entry level UX Designer and It's been a year since I've gotten laid off. I feel super discouraged. I've gotten so close to getting offers a few times but it hasn't worked our yet. Anyone else still looking for a job 1 year after their layoff? Just wanna know if I'm not alone in this.
Are they assholes or just scared?,"I was laid off from my job of two years a few months ago. While I dealt with the normal emotion of stress/anger etc, I was a bit hurt that my old coworkers (whom we worked in the same office, talked about family life, vacations, and seemingly liked each other) did not say a single word to me. Not the day of, not since, and it's the whole team. (meanwhile, other people in the company reached out with kind words.)

Is this normal in your experience? Am I too sensitive about this? I feel that it's common human decency to say at least ""I am sorry, good luck."" I definitely do (did) that with friends and colleagues.

I guess this really doesn't matter... but I just wonder... I understand that I am just a number for the company, but I kind of lost faith in people too.

And i should mention my ex-boss is a paranoid control freak. It's possible he either silenced them or they were scared. Anyways. A little vent."
The Right Way to Do It,"Look, layoffs suck, and I was let go a few months ago. There’s no pretending that it won’t suck. It was a little bit less worse for me since I experienced a much better way of being let go than most. The meeting was scheduled with the SVP of my org, it was 1:1 and on video. They were the person who hired me and I later found out they fought to be the one to tell those they know who were laid off. Wonderful leader with a spine. I still have a lot of respect for them.

Anyway, they told me that my role had been eliminated and gave me as much info as they could and said any additional questions would be handled by HR, and to let them know if they can help in any way at all. They meant it. I have them listed as a reference for future roles.

So there’s a way to make it suck less and this is definitely one. I have no respect for the upper level EC at the company though so will never go back and work there. But if this SVP leaves, and I believe it’s just a matter of time before they do, I will reach out and join their team if they offer me a role."
Anyone else taking time off before job searching?,"Mid-level SWE, getting laid off at the end of the month.  When I first found out I was going to get laid off (company is going under), I panic applied to 2 jobs, and was one step from an offer (I just needed to send references).  I ended up pulling out because I decided to take a few months off instead (also I didn’t love the role tbh).  

I went back to work in the fall after 14 weeks of maternity leave, and I’ve felt underwater since.  It just wasn’t enough time.  I’m going to take a few months to get into good healthy habits again, spend more time with the baby, get my home in order, get a better routine going, and upskill/interview prep so I can hopefully target companies that give adequate maternity leave for the next pregnancy (my state is starting 5 month leave in 2026 but that’s kind of far away).  I’m the main income earner by a lot, but we have plenty of savings.  

Anyone else taking a bit of a break? "
Wayfair Layoffs Focused on Remote Workers,"  
 

## Executives told staff Tuesday that remote workers were more likely to be let go in latest cuts

  
Employees who work remotely were more likely to be laid off in the latest round of job cuts at the online furniture seller, executives told staff on Tuesday.

Wayfair executives hosted an all-hands meeting to discuss recent layoffs that [cut 13% of its workforce](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/wayfair-boss-weeks-after-viral-memo-cuts-13-of-staff-0e89f0ef). Employees asked a range of questions about the layoffs and the financial future of the company, according to people familiar with the situation.

Workers asked about [the tone and timing](https://www.wsj.com/business/wayfairs-ceo-wants-staff-to-work-harder-your-boss-probably-agrees-86a72c1b) of a memo Chief Executive Niraj Shah sent to staff in December, weeks before the layoffs were announced, in which he asked them to work harder. Shah said Tuesday that people needed to continue to put in hard work if they expected a positive outcome for the company and for themselves. Executives told employees that the layoffs were aimed at speeding decision-making within teams.  

Other workers asked about the financial health of the company longer term. A sale isn’t being considered, said Steve Conine, co-founder of the company and co-chairman of the board. “If bankruptcy is inevitable then shame on all of us for not working harder,” he quipped from a stage in the company’s Boston headquarters. Conine was trying to emphasize that the future of the company is in Wayfair’s control, said a company spokeswoman. 

Last week, Wayfair said it would lay off around 1,650 workers. It was the fourth significant layoff at the company since 2020. Demand soared early in the pandemic, [fueling significant growth](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wayfair-posts-profit-as-online-pandemic-shoppers-spend-on-their-homes-11596639930), but sales and profits have stagnated since then. 

“We went overboard in hiring during a strong economic period and veered away from our core principles, and while we have come quite far back to them, we are not quite there,” said Shah in a memo to staff last week. 

Wayfair’s stock rose after it announced the latest layoffs but is down more than 80% from an all-time high of about $345 in early 2021. For nearly two years profit has fallen each quarter compared with the same period the previous year. 

At the meeting Tuesday, Shah said that the company continues to have some remote roles but has figured out which ones make sense in-person. Executives said that they believe most workers should be at their desks in an office on most days.

“I believe we need to stay focused as a company on what committed small teams can accomplish,” Shah wrote on Friday. “In many ways, having too many great people is worse than having too few.”

"Layed off a week ago, offer a week later. ","Well I'm still in awe at the moment, but last week I was laid off from my company unexpectedly. The entire company did a 10% cut across all divisions. There was no real rhyme or reason to it, but I was recently removed from a project I had been on for 2+ years due to funding issues from the customer. I was on the bench for about 6 weeks waiting for reassignment. During this time I started preparing my resume and up skilling in the computer graphics space as I was literally told I could get paid to do nothing, so I was preparing for a possible layoff and moving positions. Well go figure 6 weeks later layoffs happen and I'm chosen as one of the people since I'm not assigned to a project (not really my fault but whatever). 

So an hour after I'm laid off I'm already applying for jobs. I had my resume ready to go, and I went full job search mode. 9 hours a day I was applying, preparing for interviews, creating documents to help me describe the impacts I've had at the companies I've worked at, my career goals etc. I got laid off an a Tuesday and the next Monday I had an interview for a company that was opening an office in town that month, and as of today I received a verbal job offer (with documents on the way). I'm still in other interview rounds for other companies in the area, but with all the doom and gloom I read on here im just extremely grateful I found something. I only have about 4 years of work experience, and this new gig is exactly in the sub field (graphics programming within defense and aerospace) that I wanted. Sometimes the universe just works out I guess. I don't know what I did different. I don't think I did anything different than everyone else Is doing. I have a very solid resume (as told from recruiters and coworkers and my previous managers). I have a personable personality I suppose? I'm not an extrovert by any means, but not totally introverted? I probably sent out 75 resumes in the past week. Got two companies respond for interviews (the one I got the offer from and another which I have a 2nd round on Monday. I did zero cover letters. I'm not sure what else to say that I did to be honest. I also got a raise out of this. The only thing that I think REALLY secured this role was that my experience was directly transferrable to this new company. They are basically a competitor for my old company so I have a lot of domain knowledge that they need. 

I honestly hope the best for everyone here who is experiencing much longer periods of unemployment. I know it's rough out there for a lot of folks. Keep putting your best self forward and keep pushing. I hope you all find your dream roles.  "
What is everyone doing and surviving during the layoffs? How do you supplement the loss income?,"  My husband got laid off in November 2023 and still can’t find a job. His last title was product line manager and before that he  was the manager for system engineers. We are stretching 3 months emergency funds to last 5 or 6 months with unemployment income. To supplement the loss income,I enrolled to become my mom’s full time  caregiver since I was always taking care of her before. I’m going to add permitted ADU 2 beds  and 1 bath to my house which I can rent it for $2300-$2500 at where we live(Los Angeles CA). I will still get around $1450/month interest  from my CDs. So we can live off with these income while he’s looking for jobs and still unemployed. We should bring in total income$2400+$1450+$1650=$5500. It’s still less than what my husband was making but we will be ok with that amount for now.  How is everyone surviving and paying bills during these times without jobs? "

Struggling with anger; advice?,"I've been laid off twice in the last year. The first time was at my dream company and my division was sold. Great severance, manager wrote me a great letter, and helped me land some interviews. She checked in on me after the layoff several times. One of the best managers I've ever had.

The job I took after that was awful; tons of red flags but good pay. Manager was an abusive, toxic misogynist from the start. Referred to me as his ""prize"" for all his hard work. Said my only job was to make his job easier. Any development I wanted was shot down. I was not even allowed to develop myself.

I was ""laid off"" after launching a huge project by myself, and told it was because I ""can't execute"". My boss proceeds to spend the entire dismissal conversation making me feel awful, to the point that the CEO had to cut him off and tell him to stop. No severance, just a firm kick out the door.

I've since been offered a role at my original company again at a significant pay cut and demotion. Which I don't care about; I can work my way back up. It's a very prestigious company with an amazing culture and I am so excited for another chance.

Despite this, I am angry about the second dismissal, and having a hard time letting it go. I thought I'd be fine and over it once I landed a new job, but I am so mad at how I was treated. 

How do I let it go?

Edit: Thank you so much for the great advice. I think what really stuck out to me is that my anger is only hurting myself, and it's best for me to let it go, despite how unfair it was.

Those of you concerned about going back to my first company; I get it. I'm still interviewing at other places, but it is absolutely *brutal* out there right now. I've gone on dozens of interviews just for them to hire someone they know, or to promote internally, or to repost the role over and over again for 6+ months. There's a reason so many people are boomeranging back to companies that laid them off - it's very hard to get your foot into a new door right now. I know my old managers, I know my old coworkers, and at least I know I won't be referred to as a ""prize"" or ""reward"". I'm risking the culture and hoping for the best."

I feel it coming. ,"Today was challenging. 

In a surprise move, multiple co-workers were laid off this morning. The company has been doing well & they've been hiring positions not related to HR or recruiters. 

It shocked the whole team. We are a small team compared to the rest (under 20). Apparently, this was wave 3 & we had no idea.

It started as usual. The surprise 15 minute call randomly added to the calendar. I had that gut feeling. I knew it was coming. 

It was the ""if you were invited to this call, you were safe"". It was brutal. Some really talented people lost their jobs today. Worst part was one of them was a decade in & was recruited from his old position (still active today) to this position just to get it eliminated. 

I got the we are too valuable to the business conversation but I feel it coming. I feel it coming."
I don’t know what to do next,"I was laid off in October, one week after giving birth and starting my maternity leave. I waited until my 6 week postpartum appointment to begin searching for jobs again. I’ve received so many emails not getting the job and ghosted on even more applications. 

I was finally at the Director level in customer experience. I didn’t finish my degree and worked my butt off to get to that position and salary. This was my third time being laid off in the past 8 years. I don’t even think I have the energy for customer experience anything anymore, but I’m assuming that is all I can do. Sales gives me great anxiety, and I just feel inadequate in any other line of work. 

When I was laid off before, it was just my husband and I. But we now have 3 kids, more financial responsibility, on top of dealing with postpartum recovery, and my ADHD and overall sadness for feeling like I let my family down is preventing me from strategically thinking about what field/industry/line of work to get into - if I even can at all. 

I have 18 years customer/tech support/service/experience, 4 years HR experience, Agile/Scrum Master experience, program management experience, some marketing experience, team management. And yet I cry at the thought of applying to my local Walmart to get by. It’s not a bad job, its nothing to look down on, it’s honest and hard work, but I worked so so so hard to get out of that position and pay. To have to take a 70% pay cut at no fault of my own and at the beginning of parenthood just makes me sad.

If anyone has worked in CX in the tech industry and found success in another industry, what would you advise? I’m happy to answer any questions that might bring more clarity to give advice as well. I’m just so sleep deprived and financially stressed, so I appreciate any help"

Landing a job after a layoff is so difficult. Is this normal?,"I was laid off in October 2023 after 1.5 years at a startup.  
Before that, I worked at a 'unicorn' start-up and was leading a team, launching a very successful business unit which later became a market leader So, I always thought i could just join any of its competitors easily if need to.

  
Turns out, from 3 targeted competitors, one of them rejected me after the HR interview and other 2 just never contacted me back.   
Until now, i'm still unemployed. 12% of my applications get contacted back and only 6% of applications get to 1st interview. I'm getting less and less confident each time i send application or go into any interview 

Anyone ever experience similar situations ? any suggestions ?

Waiting on layoffs,"Last Monday the owner of my company told us that they need to “right size the business” during his monthly company update video. The next day my bosses bosses boss called a meeting and informed us that there would indeed be layoffs coming. We were instructed to keep our heads down, to focus on our work, and to not discuss the impending layoffs with our coworkers.

I hate this waiting game. Everyone is understandably irritable and stressed. We’re having planning meetings where the elephant in the room is being ignored. I’m sick of being in limbo. Fire me or don’t, but make your damn decision!"
Having trauma of losing a job potentially again,"I work in tech and have done backend / machine learning engineering .

I was fired from my last job at the 1 year mark. It was difficult for me and I felt like absolute sh1t.

Been with a new job now for 1.5 years now and today I got told my review isn’t too negative but not too positive either. I’m again flashing back to the same situation as before; I really don’t want to get fired again. It would be really embarrassing to get fired twice in a row 


 I just feel I’m a screw up and that I’ve ruined my career and future. No matter what I do I end up not doing well, I’ve never been promoted or worked anywhere for more than 2.5 years in my career 

I don’t know how I can recover from this ; I’m really stressed and worried and the job market is pretty bad right now."
Left Behind on a Sinking Ship,"I work at a startup that is shedding workers weekly. We have had over of year of big layoffs. It started quarterly, then monthly, and this year it’s been nearly weekly. I’m still here but it’s a special kind of torture to survive rounds of layoffs, knowing it’s just a matter of time for you, while having to pick up the work from roles that were completely eliminated. I can’t focus on anything and am starting to just feel numb. I have to remind myself to be grateful that I still have a paycheck, and I am. But it’s depressing to see your team completely dismantled, watch people who you know are high performers struggle to find their next role. I’ve been actively seeking a new role for at least 8 months. It does feel like it’s loosening up a bit but still no life preserver yet."

1. Save your personal stuff from your work computer before your login is taken away. Purists will say never use a work computer to keep personal data, but since you started working from home, the lines have blurred.
2. Download paystubs and W2s, you may need this to negotiate new offers and the login from outside VPN could be different.
3. If allowed to interact, then say bye to folks that you're leaving.

After login is taken away but before your last date:

1. Finish FSA and other pre-tax contributions. Remember that FSA is forfeited immediately after your last date, but you can spend the entire annual contribution even if you have not accrued using paycheck contributions
2. Ship your computer back to your employer
3. Apply for unemployment
4. Use your medical insurance until you have it, unless you can get a cheaper one (see next point)
5. See if you qualify for a cheaper medical insurance, especially if laid off earlier in the year, that reduces your total annual expected income.

After last date and last payment

1. Rollover 401k if they're going to charge you"
"Finally got a job offer, but the offer isn’t great","I’m feeling lucky to get a job offer after about 3.5 months of job hunting but it’s a 13k pay cut and the vacation time sucks. (1 week). I’m half tempted to take it until I can find something better. I’ve had about 15-20 interviews in the past couple of months with no success. I’m feeling pretty burnt out from the process and want a break from interviewing because it’s incredibly draining. 

It just makes me sad because my degrees (I have a bachelors and masters) and experience feel kind of worthless at the moment. Also, I feel like companies have a negative view of people that are laid off. Nearly every time I’ve mentioned that I was laid off, I can see/hear the hiring manager’s interest die. "
Does it have to be this hard?,"How can it be this hard for a man to just get a decent paying job to pay for food, clothing and shelter? ... Not for luxuries...not for vacations... Just a job to survive for him and his family... 
It's absolutely ridiculous and makes me sick - the entire interview process feels more like a power trip for some egotistical people rather than a process where 2 people get to know each other if they are fit for a job... Hr and recruiters dont call, companies keep ghosting mid process... And some interview processes take longer than my grandfather's hospital bills 😖... And add to that the constant need to re-educate and retrain to stay relevant in the market... How and when exactly are we to re-educate and retrain when you don't have money to put food on table ... It certainly does feel overwhelming.. Sorry for the rant"
Some thoughts on reasons for the tech layoffs,"I've worked in tech for a long time. When I first start my team was just me and a graphic designer. As the years we went on we added an analytics person. Than a UI person. In hindsight these roles made sense and those fields have really become disciplines unto their own. 

A few more years passed and I saw the advent of Agile. With Agile came all sorts of odd roles. Scrum masters. Release Train Engineers. Dev Ops. But importantly in my opinion the rise of the business analyst, project manager, program manager, product owner etc. 

At first we only had one product owner which sort of made sense. You need someone to define the vision. Historically that was someone like a vice president who was paying for the whole shebang. That model was simpler.  They were the ones writing the check so to speak and they would seemingly be held accountable if the thing didn't do commercially well. Eventually we got more and more ""product"" people. They also came way down in rank. I think this is were the real problem begin.

The ""product"" people acted like they were the developers boss but they weren't. A lot of developers knew more about how to make a great product than the product owners. I always found it kind of dumb that they thought developers didn't know ""what"" a good app looked like. 

I think this animosity and in-fighting really slowed things down. When the money was good for the most part no one cared. Now the money is tighter so people do care. I think companies are realizing you don't need all these extra roles. 

Now I know there are plenty of developers being laid off as well and to be frank that's another matter. I'd be interested to see the breakdown in people being laid off. How many are actual hands on keyboard developer. Nonetheless I think you get my point which is we’ve added to many fluff nonsensical positions."
Discord is laying off 17 percent of employees,
Feeling Hopeless,"This job hunt has been really rough. I got laid off about 4 months ago. And I have severance for another month. I’m starting to panic. I know that others have had it a lot worse. Sorry to anyone else who reads this and is also struggling.

I just want to share that my motivation is at an all time low. I feel like my career is over. It gets harder every week to deal with the rejections. Oh well. I’m taking a break for a day and will continue on."
Have a feeling I’m next. What should I do?,"My company announced layoffs today. It’s a smaller company and 30 people were let go. This is the first round of layoffs since I started, but I’m relatively new here and have a gut feeling I could be affected in the next round. CEO said he doesn’t anticipate more cuts, but I don’t think he would tell us if he did anticipate that lol. My anxiety has been on 10 since finding out about the news, I can’t help but think that I’m next. I’ve been laid off once and it completely caught me off guard so I had no time to prepare, but since I see this coming I want to prepare and be smart about it. Any tips or advice?"
2024 layoff season,"
2024 has kicked off with a bunch of layoffs.

Here is the list of some of the big companies that have cut jobs since the year began: 

Amazon, Google, Walmart, BlackRock, Citigroup, Macy's, Universal Music, Xerox and now Wayfair


Who are we hearing is next?"
Husband keeps asking if I’m excited about the jobs I’m applying for,"I want to tell him fuck no, stop asking. However, each time I’ve explained to him no I’m not as I’m not trying to get my hopes up when I’ll ultimately be disappointed by a rejection email or ghosted altogether. Yet he keeps asking. 

I was laid off a week after giving birth (No, I can’t proceed with any legal action because they are a small company and I can’t prove I was laid off due to giving birth). This is my 3rd time being laid off in 8 years. Not only is there anxiety depression and trauma from being laid off, but dealing with postpartum at the same time is extremely stressful.

He frequently states he’s hoping I get a job soon, and similar sentiments said in a different way and it is stressing me tf out to the point where I’m not even enjoying time with baby. I got my tubes tied so I will literally never be able to have moments like this again. I don’t know why he expects me to be in good spirits when he is constantly talking about my lack of employment in some way shape or form which is making me feel guilty for something that was literally beyond my control. Someone giving me the opportunity for a new role is literally out of my control. I was making more than him in my previous role, and instead of looking for a new job that pays him more because he actually has a degree and better options available to him, it seems as though he’s just banking on me doubling my salary and him staying comfortable in his current role that doesn’t even pay enough to contribute to household needs outside of bills. "
"Laid off few months ago, happening again?","Hey, I was laid off for the first time last year (B2B SaaS tech start-up - should have seen it coming) and it was a terrible experience. It took me a long time to get through/over it. I’m lucky and managed to get a job in another B2B SaaS company after 5months or so but I’m starting to see all the signs of lay-offs in my new company… and I am scared I’m going to get laid-off again. Also worried that I will become “devalued” having been laid-off twice.

Should I try and find another job in the tech sector already (it’s what I know & very qualified in) or just leave it all behind and get a simpler job like working in my local bakery when/if the time comes? Feel like packing it all in and serving elderly folk some coffee and cake. 

Not sure if I’m after any answers here. Just a bit scared and wondered if other people have gone through this?

UK btw. "

"PIP ""trauma"" - legit or melodramatic?","A friend works at a big tech firm. Been there for several years with top reviews, rapid promotions over 3 managers. He switched managers again one last time. He met or exceeded all of his core goals and metrics. Things looked great.

Suddenly manager starts loading him up with random side quest projects, many involving cat herding and new types of work, and such projects have been disasters for others in the past. 

Despite the distractions, core goals continue to be met or exceeded. Makes progress on side quest projects but prioritizes core goals and is always transparent with manager about priority when they conflict. No objections. No complaints. Everything seems good. 

Suddenly manager ambushes him. He's been compiling a list of every little mistake or criticism over the past month. It's all focused on side quest projects, and the criticism is all about what he could have done better or faster. Even though core goals met or exceeded, manager claims he missed opportunities to do even better. Zero of this criticism was ever mentioned to him before. 

He buckles down and works crazy hours over the next 2 months, sleeping badly and ignoring all but work.
Manager continues documenting nitpicking criticism of everything he does. 

No matter what he did it wasn't good enough. Many projects felt setup to fail because they delt with solving intractable problems others had already failed to solve, and it was too much to manage on top of his core goal work.

This turned into a formal PIP, which of course was in the making the entire time. He realized there was no winning and quit. He is super depressed and mentally messed up. I'm kind of worried about him.

He later found out his manager likely was forced to pick someone to PIP and for political reasons it was him. So it all sort of makes sense now. He rationally realizes this wasnt really about his performance. But he feels totally ""gaslit"" to the point where he no longer trusts his own judgment and competence, since he was blindsided. Even if he realizes the PIP was illegitimate, he blames himself for being naive and stupid to think he could just work harder.

I don't know what to tell the guy. I'm worried he will languish and never go back in. Is he just being melodramatic? I've never been through something like this. I can imagine it screws up your mind to be in a position where everything you do is deemed deficient, suddenly, after years of the opposite, and it can grind away at your sense of reality.

Is this a legit form of mental trauma to go through this? Or is he just being melodramatic. I'm tempted to give him a tough talk to put it behind him, but I have no idea what this experience does to someone's psyche. It does sound kind of like slow white collar torture.

Everyone talks about dealing with layoffs. Compared this backdoor layoff technique, a straight up layoff would have been a breeze."
Why there is developer shortage inspite of layoffs?,"
Is there a shortage of software engineers?
Yes, you guessed correctly! In 2023, the software engineering industry faces a record-breaking shortage of professionals. This skills crisis has resulted in an astonishing 1 million tech job vacancies that still need to be fulfilled.

Reports suggest that the number of US job vacancies, due to a lack of talent, will reach 85.2 million by 2030. Furthermore, this could result in businesses losing nearly $8.4 trillion in income during this period. Organizations in the US have been trying various strategies to combat this imminent talent shortage problem.

The current landscape of the Developer Shortage in 2023  

According to the US Labor Department, the number of software engineers, quality assurance analysts, and testers living in the US is much less than the current need.

According to 64% of IT executives, finding qualified IT people is a significant barrier to implementing new technology. Network security, the digital workplace, IT automation, platform, computer infrastructure services, and storage and database systems are the most impacted areas.

Due to a lack of qualified candidates, there were around 1 million IT job openings in the U.S. in 2019, despite a 34% increase in job posts during the year's first half. The tendency has worsened through 2023 and is predicted to increase by several times that much over the next ten years.

By 2025, according to a market research company IDC, there will be a 4 million developer shortage.  

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be a need to fill about 200,000 developer jobs yearly in the next ten years.  

There may be 1.2 million open engineering positions by 2026.

Nearly 3 in 5 developers took a job recently or plan to in the coming 12 months, the latest sign of a recovering market for job seekers after broad layoffs in 2023, according to a CoderPad report released Tuesday. The company surveyed 13,000 developers and 5,500 technical recruiters for the report. 

More than two-thirds of developers say they feel more security in their roles compared to 2023. Just 1 in 5 are concerned about stability compared to last year.

My question to you all is that what are the skills that are missing from the current generation of developers ?

Done,"Got laid off Nov '23 after 22 years becuase (as i figured out) we were going trough a move in orgs, and the COO org we were moving to probably announced that we needed to cut expenses. I got 8 weeks of being considered a ""on leave"" employee that ended on Jan 27. The merge was Feb 7! That's how i figured out why 14 of us were laid off.

After applying for a couple dozen PM positions, I got a Linkedin message from a recruiter wanting to interview me. Went well, and got an interview with the company. Went well and really thought I had it, and I really wanted it because it was a 2 year contract, and my original plans we to retire in 2 years anyway. Didn't get it.

I immediately filed to take my 44 week severence lump sum. Got it this morning, so I am officially retired. Obviously not ideal, but we'll survive. Monday I will rollover my 401k, apply for the cash plan monthly ""pension"" and apply for SS.

&#x200B;

Best of luck to all of you! Trust that everything will work out!"
Finally caught in the middle of layoffs and I was looking since LAST YEAR....,"We had a change in leadership last year and the company strategy immediately shifted towards controlling costs and operational efficiencies. I saw all the warning signs back then and started looking for a job. HUNDREDS of applications later and fast forward a year, the layoffs have finally caught up with me and I was told my position will be eliminated end of this month.

I am honestly scared and don't know what to do. I did everything career advisors preach but I've still not been able to secure a role 1 year on even with several years of experience. 

This market doesn't seem to care anymore about how much experience you have. It seems like cost is the only variable now, and given that companies have the freedom to hire cheaply anywhere in the world, how am I supposed to even compete??!"
Stop buying Amazon,"The only way to teach big corporations is with your wallet. Change insurance providers often, don’t be loyal to any one retailer, don’t let one retailer monopolize the market. Find a product on Amazon but go directly to their site to buy. 

Edit: To be clear, the objective is to prevent monopolies or duopolies. I know the small guy can never beat the big corps but doesn’t mean we can’t use our collective purchasing power. The AMC saga with Wall Street bets is a good example of how the small guy stuck it to big Wall Street. "
New trend on LinkedIn? Instead of saying I'm layed off folks are embarking on new adventures 🚢 ,
When you find your exact position that got eliminated back on the job website,I got laid off because my position was eliminated. Now it is suddenly back on the market less than two months later. I think I'm going to be sick.
Are the layoffs happening only in large and public traded companies?,"We all see layoffs of 1000s of people everyday almost, but I wonder if it is only for the large corps (1k+ employees), or you see this on small/medium companies (200-300 employees) as well?

i was impacted on my previous role (14k employees) and now I work for a medium size company that isn’t public (yet) so I was wondering how’s the market for companies of this size.

Edit with further details: The reason I’m asking is because seems like the public traded companies are being rewarded by shareholders for laying off people. The more the better.
For smaller and non public traded companies this wouldn’t really make sense."
Don't be fooled by job numbers,"Civilian Labor force population has fallen - that is what you are experiencing in your daily lives.

The news story about how ""great"" the jobs reports are rely on one key element- government jobs.

I think we can all tell the difference between the two, and I believe what we are seeing in realtime is resources (both human and non-human capital) being transferred from the private sector to the public.

So: no you aren't crazy for the dissonance between the mainstream narrative and what you're experiencing in your daily life."

It’s so annoying cos of course movies are made up. You see people living in suburbs like it’s easy peasy.

Got notice of layoff today - just wanted to share my thoughts somewhere.,"So I work in the accounting/finance department of a company whose name shall be withheld. Today we got notice of a layoff due to an acquisition, with all of us being laid off effective immediately to five months out (when the new company's accounting and finance team will be taking things over completely). I'm fortunate enough not to be one of the immediate ones. Also everyone is being offered a severance. It's small potatoes, but better than nothing I suppose.

I'm not too worried about finances right now, as I have enough money/assets to cover a year+ of expenses if needed fortunately. But I've been working in my current job for awhile, and I really like the coworkers. Aside from a period when there was an overwhelming amount of work, which ended up being fixed, I really enjoyed my job. Also knew my job like the back of my hand at this point.

It just sucks knowing that I'll never see my coworkers again in my life. Also sucks having to interview and be the ""new person,"" which is always an awkward and uneasy experience.

Shit whomps, but that's life I guess.

How bad does this sound? Lay offs around the corner?,"Hi all! I have never been laid off before however, I am suspicious that my time is coming. Here are a few things that are happening at the company I work at. Can you let me know if it seems likeay offs are likely?

H1b misinformation,"I'm seeing a lot of anti H1b / immigration propaganda crop up here about deflation of wages and how they don't help the economy etc. 

I have put up a list to help bring some perspective :
Not really for a few reasons.

1)  The H1b program isn't expanding. Every year only 85k immigrants can get an H1b. It's been this way for the last 20 years. 

2) Regarding salaries, while there are exceptions due to consulting firms, H1bs are not paid lesser than Americans. Even if both workers want the same wage, it makes more sense for the company to go with the American from a financial perspective. The foreign worker costs the company 10s of thousands of dollars more over his lifetime.

3) If wages trend upwards, the H1b wage cannot remain the same. For the paperwork to be valid, there's this thing called the prevailing wage. This number is reflective of the average salary of that profession in that location and it will increase with the trend.

4) H1b workers can't work on projects that require clearance. Only greencard holders and Americans can do that.

5) H1b workers are a bad bet in the long term for employers. Each time they leave the country, there's a small chance they can be arbitrarily deported. The H1b is valid for 6 years at most and there's a decent chance the worker might not be able to extend it beyond that. So you risk losing an employee you've been honing for years and who has lots of industrial knowledge for no fault of your own.

6) H1b workers (and immigrants in general) are here for economic opportunities. Their limited stint in the US means they have no loyalty and jump ship for higher salaries without regrets. They want to maximize the money they make while they are here. So they actually drive salaries upwords by interviewing everywhere and negotiating salaries hard.

7) H1b workers are usually in tech or medicine, both of which are amongst the highest earning careers in the US. They pay the same FICA taxes as you. That's 8% of your paycheck.

You are paying this to fund the old 65 yo retired American in your country and you give them 1800 dollars a month. If this guy lives to 85, that's $430,000 in payments.

Now the understanding is that you pay this while you are young and working, and the next generation of workers will fund your SS when you're 65.

But working immigrants get zero benefits from this. So in a way, all these H1b professionals collectively pay billions of dollars that will fund you in your retirement.

And I'm not 100% sure but these workers can't apply for unemployment benefits either. But they're still funding that pool.

So yeah, despite what Fox News tells you, these immigrants are insanely important for the US. The H1b program obviously has issues, but it's a deadlocked Congress obsessed with appealing to their voters who fail to pass meaningful and commonsense reform.

PS: when times are hard and we're all competing for dwindling jobs, then yeah, it sucks to compete with immigrants. But they only get 60  days to find a new job and then leave the country so you already have a massive advantage. 

But during normal times and boom periods, these immigrants keep the US economy running and our government programs funded."
Worst layoff experience?,"Personally mine was either the time I was laid off whilst in the air on my way to my family holiday. Took off …had a job,  the time I landed in 8hrs…no job. I only knew because my phone no longer worked and a colleague who also got let go pinged me on my personal email. 
The other time was when I was recovering from an operation at home and the boss knocked on my door and handed me an envelope and walked away. I had my revenge on him as 4yrs later (after his company failed) he was a candidate for a job I was on the interview panel for. Needless to say he didn’t get the job. 

What’s your worst experience?"
"Experience ""Revenge of the Hiring Managers"" in 3D!  More gore than before!","Rant warning:  After a few years of employees having the upper hand during covid, corporations are punching back and it is brutal. Layoffs combined with a grueling hiring process threatens to put the last nail in the coffin of the middle class.  Its been a long time coming.

In the interview process we are being asked to recite the company values and mission statement  like a holy oath. I was advised to wear something with the company colors to the interview and say how much I adore the corporate life. Is this a cult?

It's just a job. It's not anyone's whole heart and life. Even the guys at the top are only doing this for the money. Very few companies are about helping people and I respect them.  But the vast majority are chasing dollars any way they can. And to helll with the workers.

Will the cycle reverse again?  Not for many years imo.  Not ever if corporations can help it.

What is it with all the hate and negativity in this community?,"When I joined this community, people were very supportive, helpful and positive. Right now I am seeing a lot of posts where people are putting each other down, being abusive and harsh towards others and not being positive or supportive.

Everyone's circumstances are different. Some need access to healthcare, others need access to food, or legal services, housing, fuel for their cars, therapy, visas, etc. Some people may want to take a break and others may want to look for another job asap. Some just need a place to rant or talk it out and others need referalls or a shoulder to cry on or just someone to tell them that ""it will get better"".

We should be the community to help people and support them. I don't know why we are not that anymore."

"Newly laid off, apologies if this is redundant , where are the jobs?","EDIT TO ADD:

Without selling myself out, athletic footwear and apparel brands is most of my past. All the big names. Held roles domestic and overseas. Director level, 15 years experience. I am applying to strategy and operations roles at similar companies, consultancies, and in digital spaces, but sports there is nothing at the moment.

see so many posts “best job market in history”

I see so many posts about how hard it is to land a job. But lots of those posts are about tech or entry level roles and supposedly the job market overall is still good, so I am confused.

Just confused because I was under the impression January was peak job posting month and I’ve seen legit 3 jobs, all would be a 50% paycut and still none are calling me back.

I was laid off in December. Had my resume professionally written, had LinkedIn updated, etc.

I’ve applied for every job out there, nothing. Now the boom of jobs to come in Jan there are NONE. Literally 3 in my market. THREE. I’m applying outside of industry , also no news.

I’m reaching out to people I know, no one is replying. I’m being rejected for jobs that are a step down.

I have experience at fortune 100 companies both domestic and overseas… I don’t get it. 

Is this the new normal? Or am I just a shit and ok to discard now that I’m a 40YO female? 

I must’ve written 50 people on LinkedIn. I posted my resume a few times on Reddit, also no response. I really don’t want to use the green banner because I just did a big search in 2021 and now I feel like the asshole always hunting around for a job. 

I had 4 offers in 2021, it feels like a ghost town right now and I’m just wondering if it’s a me problem.

Example: two hiring managers who I have met before  looked at my LinkedIn after I applied to roles and neither have reached out or replied to my messages.

It’s making me very insecure

I should be in my peak earning years and I feel like I’ve missed every chance to get ahead. 

Graduating in 08 was bad enough, inJUST caught up on retirement. I feel totally fucked and I’m just wondering is this me? 

Are some people landing jobs quickly and I just haven’t figured out the way yet? "

Impending Layoff,"I’ve been in tech for almost two years now and I didn’t know what’s coming when I started. 

This is a company that’s public and it’s at more than 1B in terms of valuation but the first month, year ‘22, they laid off a few and then it just snowballed every quarter and now I’m worried about losing my job since they completely cut off my budget for this quarter and I think the entire year. I have always made my Key metrics even the last quarter at more than 100% AvT but for some reason they just decided to cut the budget completely 

I just don’t know what to feel, it’s like I’m just waiting for something to happen and the bad thing about this is that the executives I work with are not saying anything . I am thinking that if there’s going to be layoffs, they will sweep this one (I’m thinking this january ) under the rug"

Has anybody here been unemployed for more than 1 year?,"I just found this community and personally I've been out of a job since July 2022. I will admit I was asked to step down because of some politics at the startup I helped found and I was optimistic about transitioning into a different industry (passion of mine but life has other plans) so I was selective in the beginning. Cut to 2023, I had to wait for my Greencard to come in before I could start working again (took about 9 months) and this made the gap balloon. I've been looking since last August and have been open to pretty much anything as long as it's the same job profile (I can't do much else) and still haven't had any luck. I had one founding offer but I declined it because the company is super early stage and founder was unreliable - now I'm thinking if I made a mistake. Posting here to ask folks - is this really that bad? Having a long gap in your resume? Should I add a section explaining it or leave it for the recruiter screen? My assumption is I'm not even making it to the screen because of it, what do you think? Also, how bad in a situation am I (I have about 7 YOE, now a PM)? I've gone through almost every penny of my savings and investments at this point and while I'm not crying about that because I'll make it all again but just want to get a feel of the situation from others."
New job during lay off notice period,"Accepted a job at a new company, the next morning was laid off at current company before I could give notice.

New internal role to avoid layoff but 25% pay cut?,"My role in the company is about to be eliminated soon. There's an internal role which has been offered. But it comes with a 25% pay cut.

I'm quite conflicted about this because the job market is terrible now, so it may take some time for me to secure a new role.

That said, I'll be quite resentful with a 25% pay cut for a role in the same company. If it's a role in the same company, they should at least match my current pay no? This feels wrong on so many levels.

Also, if I were to take the 25% pay cut as a stop-gap measure, I'm afraid it could affect salary negotiations in future, be it internal or external job opportunities. As employers in my country have the tendency to ask for last drawn pay, and peg offers based on that.

Would love to hear thoughts on this. Thanks in advance!"
Waiting to see the silver lining,"Got laid off a few days back. 

I work in upper management for a very large US based company, and based in India. Strategy and Transformation domain, not tech, 20 years total experience, 10 years in company. 

Role redundancy as a new team merged with us and led to too many managers. 

Boss extended me the grace, made huge exception, told me in advance. Gave me 6 months to find something internal or external. After 3 months, it was formalised with HR. There were others who were blindsided. I continue to work during my garden leave of 3 months, out of choice. Mutual respect, no bad blood. 

Businesses need to make those decisions as overall company is doing pretty bad this year. 

Grateful for people I worked with and skills I developed. Boss is very supportive to give external referrals and talk to internal hiring mangers. 

Searching casually for last 3 months and gearing up since last 1 month. Few conversations but nothing concrete. 
Financially, I can sustain for upto a year but I need engagement. 

Got a strong feeling that universe is pushing me to something bigger and better. I wouldn’t have left it in my own.

If you are in a situation to have to let people go, do it with grace and in a humane way. Regardless of what HR guidance is. It goes a long way! Jobs end, careers and lives don’t."
"Company laid me off before my retirement account vested, therefore they take all their matches back.","Worked at a tech company for two years and 9 months, and was laid off with the rest of my team due to workforce reduction. My retirement account had a large amount of money in it, which included a lot from my employer‘s matches. However, it seems they will be taking all of their matches back since the vesting period is 3 years. Is this correct?

&#x200B;

I read my retirement account info, and it says, “ If your employment with the Company ends before you are vested, you will forfeit any Company Matching Contributions and any earnings on those contributions.” Vesting time is 3 years, and I only had 2 years and 9 months. What a sh#t way to screw over your employees out of money you promised them."

Laid off at RPO,"I was just hit with my first layoff in my career, working for an RPO after the client slowed their hiring needs. I feel really lost and after 3.5y of working at kinda a dream job, it's incredibly difficult to have any feelings of self worth looking for jobs. I was laid off after returning from a 10-day OOO for gender-affirming surgery and was really counting on coming back to work and having time to heal properly working remotely.  


Now it's incredibly hard to not find recruiting roles that aren't specialty (since I never got exposure to those roles), or 100% commission based. I'm really stressed and contemplating a 20-30k pay cut trying to find something local."
Layoff/Economy theory,"I am a Co-Founder/Entrepreneur in FinTech. I read this board to get a pulse on the hiring market.

My theory on the economy is that compared to the previous housing led downturn, this time the jobs being lost are high profile. To begin with, there was pandemic stimulus excess savings to keep the average person buoyant. Then, there are layoff packages from tech companies which I find extremely generous. The most severance I had ever seen in the past was 3 months. Many of the people I know are well to do and can afford to “hang out,” albeit would need to keep spending in check.

Many people (thinking 30+ age) have multiple sources to tap into in order to keep going, such as tapping equity of inflated home prices.

So, this is one possible reason why the economy hasn’t cratered and may not. It could be a continuous slow drip/death by a thousand cuts environment.

This isn’t to minimize the situation of those less fortunate, but just proposing a theory.

I want you to know I personally am trying my best. I am not a SV CEO. Proud of what I have helped to build, but it’s tough. I was around during 00-03. This feels different. Maybe because I am older and can’t be taught anymore (I feel lucky that I got into Web 3 in my 40s). That said, all of our expectations on life’s achievements have come down. 

Hang in there."
"If you have good support network , you have everything even if you get laid off/ fired","If you are fortunate enough to have people in your corner who are

I was told to go work at McDonald’s or Wendy’s after I didn’t find a tech job immediately after graduation ( it took me two months to land a job)

I wanted to take  a 3 month break when I was fired from another job but was guilted into taking another job in two months . Again blamed for it and made to feel like a failure

Advice for laid off 63 year old father?,"Hey all - I’m posting on behalf of my father. My father was recently working at a startup in the biopharmaceutical industry and was laid off. 
He’s worried that he’s going to have to be forced to retire early. He’s not financially ready to retire early since he has to support retirement for more than himself. But he’s worried that his age and his international experience and background will prevent him from ever working again. He previously held a senior director role but thinks he’s too old to qualify for junior level roles. 

Any advice for the older generation? Or for immigrants? Or people in higher positions? My heart breaks knowing how much he’s aged just from the sheer amount of stress. He won’t  have health insurance anymore and I’m worried about the stress and his health.

I’ve suggested to him working with executive recruiters but I don’t really understand how they work. I also don’t work in his industry so don’t really know how to help. Would love advice!"

My role was NOT publicly posted on any job boards and I had never heard of the company, but a former boss now mentor of mine sent the description to me because it came through his proximate network. Admittedly, the description didn’t initially fit my career vision bit it did fit my skills and interests. I was tempted to pass on it because ego and the company was just outside of what I’ve been doing the last decade.

I wrote the stupid cover letter to apply, and two interviews with no performance tasks later I’m in a role so sweet I don’t even care about the title downgrade and slight pay cut form my previous role.

May be laid off. Told my manager and his manager I was diagnosed with cancer.,"Hi all,

I may be part of a large layoff at my company in the next week or two. Last fall I was diagnosed with cancer (it’s common and treatable). I told them my diagnosis and that I may need short term disability for treatment. 

For the first time in the 4 years I’ve been there I got a bad review at end of year. But I performed as I did in my role as I’ve always had done. This is a clear sign I may be on the layoff list. 

My question is when they approach with specs of severance how do I handle? I have evidence of their knowledge of my cancer. 

I’m willing to stand my ground to get what I want (especially having them pay for my healthcare for the rest of the year). Just not sure what other legal avenues I have. 

Thanks for any advice."

Company is sinking and expect a layoff in a few months. What to do?,"Background: My company already laid off half the people in October and the business continues to sink. The problem is the management is focused on a new product that they have zero experience creating meanwhile our main business is massively underperforming and our main investor/client is unhappy and may pull the plug. The company has enough cash to continue into 2025 but sentiment is we will have another round of layoffs sooner. There are rumors of a couple people already putting in notice.

I know I should be trying to find a new job as well but it’s been very slim pickings and frankly I am just depressed. The company aggressively lied to me about the state of the business and my role so I have relatively few accomplishments to point to during my one year tenure here. I have savings to hold me over for over a year fortunately.

I am seeking advice from anyone who may have experienced something similar. What should or could I do?

Edit: appreciate the feedback. As many have said: the solution is to just get another job ASAP. Consciously, I know that is the answer, but subconsciously I am depressed by the job and the weak job market and struggling to get moving on the job hunt. I guess I should be asking for how to get motivated while still employed. "

How did I get back on my feet?,"Laid off along with other members of my team and the larger organization mid summer 2023. I work in finance so who cares? It’s not as bad as tech so I’ll be back up soon! … so I arrogantly thought. 

Hunkered down, prayed a lot and made interviewing my full time job. Was interviewing at least twice a day in two time slots: 10:30 am - 12:30 pm break to eat then 2pm - 4:30 pm.

As days turn to weeks and the rejections start piling up I started to wake up in the middle of the night having nightmares of getting evicted as cash begins to ran to dangerously low levels. Barely any sleep because was nervous about interviews coming up in the am and eyes could not shut as I laid down.

Made it to the final round of one particular interview and got asked to submit my referrals. They were called, everything was all set, got a call on a Friday in cold December to discuss my potential offer details and was told official offer will come the next Monday. Come the next Tuesday and I get an email saying they decided to hold off till end of Q2 2024 because they think bad economy will affect their business and want to see how the year plays out. Looked up to the heavens for answers as to why this pain and suffering but they didn’t come. Over two months of progressively hard interviews and case studies all for nothing. Why??? 

Completely deflated so I take two days off then continue to move forward. Cash is running out, getting out of bed is hard but can’t feel pity for myself. I have no choice and nothing to lose as I am headed for eviction in January 2024. I have to keep going as I deal with brain fatigue from constantly interviewing and intrusive thoughts. 

Emotional rollercoaster from getting emails from recruiters at various firms then getting rejection emails from those same people as “they have decided to move on with other candidates.” Receiving emails to set up time for  interviews from HR people, once a source of hope would later become a source of pain as I am passed up for other candidates. Needless to say some of these organizations really deserve a tombstone because ghosting is their alter ego.

Had a couple good friends I used to share my issues with once a week. Some were in the same boat so we’d meet and encourage and strengthen each other. Was preparing to take Christmas week through New Year’s Day off then get back to it in Jan 2024. 

Missed half of my summer due to staying indoors and interviewing. Gained 20 pounds and belly fat is off the charts! All my gym gains gone. Can’t even smile back at women in public. As for dating…what dating? Lack of confidence is beginning to affect decisions I make concerning my life in many areas than I can count including going to the gym and maintaining my blood sugar level which is spiking due to bad diet. Only goal for 2024 was to get back on my feet any how. How will that happen? I don’t know. If there is a miracle, it has to happen before year end or else for sure I am getting evicted end of January. It’s December 20th, 2023 now.

Then I wake up on the 22nd of December to an email telling me I had gotten an offer for a company I had completed hard rounds of  interviews with a month ago and thought they had ghosted me. 

5 months of pain, struggle, hits to my confidence, self doubt, nightmares, intrusive thoughts all disappear immediately into the ether! Praise God! That’s how quickly your life can change in an instant. 

Can’t stress this enough but you can NEVER QUIT. Godspeed."

"Nike plans to cut 1,600 jobs",[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/nike-plans-cut-over-1600-jobs-wsj-2024-02-16/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/nike-plans-cut-over-1600-jobs-wsj-2024-02-16/)
Got a job offer but it’s not what I want ,"I need money so I’ve accepted it, since I’ve been unemployed since August other than a short three-month contract gig. I’ve applied to over a thousand jobs I think, probably gotten at least half as many rejections, maybe 20ish interviews, and this is the only offer I’ve gotten. I’m in marketing. 

But new job is 1) contract-to-hire, so I’m only a temp right now 2) pays 30% less than what I made at my job before I was laid off and 3) sets me back at the same pay as I was seven years ago. Still, I am grateful and I have a family to support so I need this. Really trying not to feel bitter. And it’s mostly remote, except for “intentional” days in the office, so up to two days a month I’d be commuting an hour each way.

*edited to add: I want to offer this update as some kind of encouragement to everyone still struggling!  🫶"
Getting laid off my brewing job ,"Getting cut in a couple weeks, been brewing for the last 5 years and don’t know what to do really. Came as a big surprise. 

Two options I can do immediately, get another brewing job for less money or go on unemployment and go to Thailand for a month. What would you guys do?"
Venting... ,"I just applied for food stamps, this is a very weird and odd feeling. I've been volunteering since I was laid off which has turned, unexpectedly, into a full time job.

I'm on month 14 of being unemployed, been actively and aggressively looking for the last 9 months as was dealing with health issues the 5 months prior (my body literally broke from stress).

I have two degrees, a minor, 25 years of experience and still can't land anything. 

I've done many interviews, which I've been overqualified for, only to be passed over for an internal hire. Ive been trying hard to mentally not take it personally too. 

But, I'm starting to resent this countries backwards, throw away, no excuse, get out employee, culture.

Wish there were more penalties for mass layoffs from corporate places, especially when they are reporting record profits. 

We are expected to balance and manage our checkbooks/lives, but companies can carelessly waste money and get rewarded, but blame employees who are making them profitable. Was worse off the last recession, but so tired of this rollercoaster as I know more will come and at higher frequencies if things are allowed as they are today. 

I'm grateful that I could last this long on savings and making ends meet, but this will pass and I'll be okay, just needed to vent as I'm feeling very loser-ish, second guessing my skillset and my personhood. "

Recession? Why isn’t the Press reporting it?,"The press continues to report the economy and unemployment are in good shape. Is the reason:

A. Incompetence

B. Because every news org is

C. Collusion to hide the recession. Tilt presidential election toward the incumbent.

D. All of the above


Your vote?"
Laid off twice last year (Rant),"The search is a drag, just sucks man. It’s been 2.5 months since the second layoff and I’m growing tired of the interview cycle. While I’ve had consistent traction, I haven’t received any offers. I’ve progressed to final rounds with 5 different companies, only to be passed on by all of them, with little to no feedback. 

Most of these interviews include a presentation. It feels like they just take my ideas, and then cherry-pick an answer that they don’t like to justify passing. Just sucks man. 

It doesn’t matter if I nail the presentation. It doesn’t matter if a connection refers me for the role. It doesn’t matter if my experience is directly aligned with the JD. They will find a reason to pass. The worst part is that there is no feedback loop, so I don’t know what I’m doing “wrong”. I know for certain that two companies that passed to “pursue other candidates” did not have other candidates lined up during my interviews. 

At a low point right now after connecting with a hiring manager who told me to apply for a role. I applied, spoke with a recruiter, and was then passed on. Didn’t even get a chance to do a formal interview and present my experience. This one stings man, going to try to appeal. 

Each hiring experience is so subjective so far - there doesn’t seem to be a silver bullet.  At this point, with my network mostly exhausted, it seems like I just have to stick it out long enough until I get lucky.  

Cross your fingers for me!"
"If you’ve been laid off, I suggest going to a dealership…","I’m going to give you guys some advice. Dealership sales is not for everyone. There is a lot of BS you have to deal with. You have to kiss managers asses. You have to kiss customers asses. You have long hours. You work holidays/weekends. You have to deal with dealership politics. You’ll see the people that get spoons (deals handed to them by management). You’ll get kinked (another salesman closes your customer & takes you off the deal)

However, working at a dealership teaches you so many life lessons. I want my kids to work minimum 1 year at a dealership. I think it builds character.

Now, here is the beauty of it:

Dealerships will hire anyone with a pulse. It’s commission based, but you will have a draw or hourly pay. So, if you’re not cut out for it, at least you’ll get paid the couple months you tested it out.

Earning potential is unlimited. In my 5 years, I have not made less than low 6 figures. Top 5 guys usually range from 220k-150k. I’m always on the top 8 out of 18. I know I can make more money, but I also know my personality type, and I do get somewhat lazy when I make my 10k for the month.

You’ll have no boss breathing down your neck (unless you aren’t making deals)

Dealerships are still old school. Dress nice, take a resume with you, and go down to the dealership & ask to speak with a sales manager.

Good luck to you"

Is the pharma industry in recession?,"My father was laid off from a large and very well known pharma company in June 2023.

Don't give up - dreams come true,"I just got an offer yesterday, exactly 2 months after being cut.

No longer in IT, completely different industry and was offered the job on the spot - everyone on the panel reached and shook my hand, twice.

I'm posting this to give people hope, and tell you what I had to do make this happen, for inspiration.

I'm an IT professional of 14 years, systems administrator, and a video editing hobbyist and cartoon animator for 16 years, and I've mastered keeping plants so well as a hobby that I'm the green man (other than Hulk).

To get this role I had to pull out the hobby skills, the stuff I do and enjoy for free, driven by passion. I interviewed with an organization in the industry of one of these hobbies,, and they were so impressed they offered the job right then and there on a piece of paper they signed right there. Got email for onboarding today.

I'd recommend - utilize all skills you have when applying. You could be a self taught pro from a hobby and not even know it.
Apply out of state - companies are willing to get top talent outside their state borders
Even if you're in the middle if the final round interviews, keep applying - the one that grabs you could be one you just applied to while the others are taking time through their processes.

Opinion | It’s Not Just Wages. Retailers Are Mistreating Workers in a More Insidious Way.,
When the scribes revolted during the Ottoman Empire due to the introduction of the Printing Press,"Yes, this is related to layoffs-

Please don't fall for the hindsight bias or the hindsight effect. 

In the 15th century when the Printing Press was introduced-The Ottoman Empire initially rejected it , as a matter of fact the scribes revolted and at the time the Sultans, Viziers (prime ministers), governors (Valis), judges (Qadis), and military commanders PANICKED. 

The Ottoman Empire did not adopt it for 300 years.  
At the time the Ottoman Empire(Muslim world) was very much ahead of the Europeans in terms of Astronomy, Law, Medicine, Commerce, trade, Math, Culture etc etc. 

However, the reluctance of the Ottoman Empire to  adopt the printing press gave Europe 300 years where not only did it catch up but it surpassed the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim world.

By failing to adopt this simple technology an entire geographic region, fell behind and stayed behind. The consequences and repercussions still felt today in terms of Fanatics, wars etc etc.

It is very common for people not to understand or recognize major events as they are happening. We only recognize them after they have occurred.   

AI is coming for a lot of our jobs, I am not saying it is all gloom and doom.  But it is going to replace a lot go resources.

Anything positive from this?,"Anyone think this will be a learning moment for companies? Think corporations will try to avoid having to do massive layoffs in the future outside of major recession moments? Maybe be more careful not to overhire like crazy. Or even more government intervention on the state level. My optimistic side wants to think that things are a cycle and that perhaps we can get back to that golden age where companies at least try to do right by workers and try to balance serving shareholders and taking care of the people who create that value. 

It’s a fact that layoffs don’t really help companies because it’s short term, expensive and morale goes to shit. And then we continue to have this cycle of no loyalty both ways. Going to have more and more workers who don’t care to work hard.

Or will we just continue on this path and it will become extremely rare for people to be at a company for more than a few years "
5 months in:,"Absolutely questioning my ability and skillset on certain days. Definitely wondering why I made over six figures for a couple of years just to now not even get a job paying less than half of what I made. 


Chose the unemployment flair because recently laid off doesn’t even apply to me anymore. 

Anyone in this boat? Revamped the resume (20+ times), did the networking (8 hour days of outbound), hell I even landed a contract job paying hourly for around 5-10 hours a week. 

Crickets. Had interviews, made it to final stages, but no offer in hand. 

Honestly feels like finding any sort of equivalent employment in this market is gambling."
My first layoff,"TLDR: First job. IT intern of 2 years. I got very attached to the people and job. Merger happened. Larger company lied and laid a bunch of people off, including me. Now I have two weeks left but every time I see the office I break down. I feel like a faceless alien and I want to run way. I also don’t know how to ask for the letter of recommendation they offered me.

Edit: I sounded very sad before. I was really struggling the first week. This was partially because I forgot to take my antidepressants the week prior. I’m doing better.

**Edit: Thanks everybody for the advice. Now I feel more confident looking towards the future :)**

——————

For more than two years I worked as IT intern while also attending college. I loved my job. I worked three days a week, and I commuted an hour to and from work. I felt important.

Then the merger happened. They said that nothing would change. I believed them.

A year later they laid off like half of our company. There was a whole company meeting where there was catering from Carabba’s, except for all the people who got laid off hours prior. At that meeting they said they weren’t going to lay anyone else off.

A few weeks later they told me to attend an online meeting on a day I wasn’t scheduled for work. For the past few months they excluded me from most meetings and gave me only grunt work, so I was excited. I thought they had an important test to give me… but instead they just laid me off.

I said I was appreciative for the job and grateful for my time there. They told me I could choose my end date and they’d give me a letter of recommendation. I felt ok then. I thought I’d be fine.

But then I went back to the office. Whenever I see my co-workers, whenever I hear them talk, when I see them put up Valentine’s Day decorations, when I see my co-workers having meetings without me… it kills me. At lunch I cry so hard I feel like I’m going to puke.

I’m a stranger. I don’t belong. I feel worthless. Whenever I’m there I want to disappear."

Laid off a month before maternity leave!,"After surviving 5 round of layoffs, finally got caught up when company decided to close permanently and conducted a mass layoff, issued a WARN notice and paid the severance.
This feels awful, I stayed in this company on same salary for 2 years, was hopeful that I will get promoted but my manager was changed and it never worked, then I thought I will stay till my maternity leave and then will switch once maternity benefits ends but sadly company went under :(
I feel cheated!

I stand in solidarity with all the people who were impacted this year or before, it is such a worst feeling :("
This Sucks but I’m Cautiously Optimistic,"First I got a call from my mom informing me that my grandmother had passed. Then I got a call from HR and my boss that I was being let go for “misuse of company assets” because I spent too much on client dinners in Q4…this was the Friday before Christmas. 

I had exceeded my sales numbers the previous three years even with ridiculous goals for a small publisher. The market was just so hard to gain or sustain sales in 2023. 

I remain optimistic because I fully believe many employers are forecasting rate cuts, and to those of you that have been out for a year or more? Please stay positive and optimistic with me. If the 75 basis points that are predicted to be cut from the Federal Funds rate actually happen then the job market will open with a vengeance. "
Company changed performance reviews - is this a sign of incoming layoffs?,"We used to use a numeric rating whose score was based off of what some coworkers rated you. Now the company is changing it so there is no more rating - only a set of questions that we discuss with our manager in our 1:1 - like “what are your biggest accomplishments in the past year,  “what are your biggest challenges” , “what areas do you need to improve in?”, “what has not been going well in the past year” , etc.

Is this a bad sign that the company wants employees evidence to lay off people for performance?"
Is this normal?,"I was notified of a RTO policy 3 months ago and was requested to relocate to a different state or be given 3 months notice that my layoff is happening. 

Officially Thursday of this week is my last day. I just had a meeting with a manager and they said because nothing has been put in writing I essentially have to send a ""resignation email"" to put my layoff into effect. 

Is this normal? Am I really supposed to resign even though I was told it's a layoff?

Does anyone have any experience like this? Is there a different course of action?

What are my options? Is the only option truly to just ""resign""?"

Tencent's Riot Games to lay off about 11% of staff,
Company not paying out my PTO,"Greetings everyone and happy holidays!!

I was laid off from Cognizant on November 30th and had 16 days of PTO accrued. 

The company has refused to pay out anything beyond 5 days. I already reached out to Payroll and asked them to pay me out and they’ve refused. 

I’m in Texas and they claim nothing can be done because there’s a clause in the Employee handbook. I wasn’t given severance and those extra 11 days could be a great help for me. Does anyone have a similar experience or advice for this? 
I’d truly appreciate it. Thank you and I wish everyone the best of luck."
"MS in CS, laid off from Amazon as a SDE after 2 years, unemployed for a year, back in India, last h 1 b visa attempt left","I (26M) apologize that this is a little bit long post but if you can provide your opinion or any positive feedback, please guide me.

I moved to the US in 2019 right after completing my BE in computer engineering from India and completed my MS in Computer Science in 2021. I would be very honest, I don’t like coding at all but I didn’t know what else to do and knew that this is the career where people earn the most money and was a straightforward path so I thought I would eventually like to code. So just to make it to where I wanted to be, I always used to cheat and copy and had the philosophy of fake it till you make it and did everything to finally land a job at Amazon (I cheated here as well).

Now once I started working, I instantly started feeling that I was trapped and within a few months I realized that I wasted my learning days into other things and didn’t actually learn but just did the bare minimum to get the things done. This attitude eventually started to show up on my job as well and I didn’t feel motivated at all, but I used to brag that I’m working at Amazon and it made my parents very proud as well.

This kept on going until I was put into focus (a 2 month plan where you need to meet strict deadlines or you could be fired). I failed that as well and I had a decision to make within 5 days if either I wanted to leave Amazon or try a independent project and complete it within a month to continue working. I chose neither paths and took FMLA(a loophole I found to avoid this which gives employees a paid leave that can be used if you have a disability which prolonged my decision making time period). As soon as my FMLA ended, I received the email that I was laid off.

During this time I was in a pretty bad relationship which caused me a lot of mental health issues and I went into depression because of my partner’s past and her trauma and we broke up as well after being in a live in relationship. So I switched apartments to live alone and couldn’t find the motivation to do anything at all.

While this happened, in my second h 1 b attempt, when the lottery is selected for the second round in July my application was picked but it wasn’t filed because I wasn’t working for my employer anymore. This was another blow to already happening bad events in my life. I then drifted into bad habits, smoking, drinking and going to casinos which made me very unfit and unhealthy and anxious all the time. Then I stopped talking to people and would barely talk back home as well which made my parents really concerned about me and asked me to move back to India.

So I moved back to India in January 2024 after spending a lot of time and money in US doing nothing and I’m still out of a job because I just don’t feel like working anymore.

Additionally, since I had always dreamt of living in US and lived there for 4.5 years, I’m having a very difficult time adjusting here living with my family as well. I have my STEM-OPT valid until June 2024 and 1 attempt in masters h 1 b lottery cap as well.

Furthermore, my parents and relatives have started to look for a girl to get me into arranged marriage and would marry me off probably by the end of this year or early next year.

Please advise me what should I do here and how to get my life back on track."
Beware of Succession Planning,"Layoffs are tool.

It gives corporations a way to lower costs, in an effort to meet Wall Street’s expectations for growth, ROI, dividends, profits, etc. (Talking about public companies. For private companies, the reasons are similar but varied. Let’s put that off to the side for a moment). If you lower costs and grow revenues, the jaws open (financial lingo), and your share price increases. 

How corporations assess whether it’s time to layoff people or not has a number of factors. Most well known. Succession planning isn’t. 

All managers, in every public company are asked to provide a view of who can perform their function, if they got hit by an asteroid. They are asked to name someone that can take over,  When? How long until they are ready? What training do they need?

This information in aggregate produces a great chart that says, here’s the delta in salary between the guy doing the job and the guy we can have to doing the job in x weeks, with $y amount of training. 

If the delta in aggregate is significant. Whoosh, there goes a whole division or group of people independent of and more significantly, regardless of their performance.  

I’ll leave it to the reader to figure out how to counter, but this is real. It happens all the time, but I don’t see too many conversations about it.

EDIT: Should clarified, I’m mainly talking about the managerial layers. "
How are you all pivoting to different roles/expertise after getting laid off at a mid-management level title,"I was laid off in January, at Director level - but now I am finding hard to get even a response to Director/Manager level roles.

I feel I have good skills to match and transfer over to other roles (pre-sales, solution consulting, PS, IT, program management) but my title/LinkedIn history may become prohibitive. 

How are you all handling the pivoting to different levels/roles?

I could really use some suggestions, inputs at this point."

How do companies keep layoffs hidden and “slip through the cracks”?,"Maybe I’m not not looking in the right place(s), but I’ve been attempting to find the layoff numbers for Gartner. I was part of a secondary wave of layoffs from the digital markets team in January; the first wave hit in September.

But every website I check, I can’t seem to find their name anywhere (as far as lists of companies that have laid off employees this year, or reporting by state). How is it that companies can just lay people off, completely unnoticed? Is it because the numbers just aren’t large enough in each batch? You would think somebody would be reporting but it’s just crickets from what I can see. 

Any insight as to the lack of coverage? TIA! "
Twitch Laying Off 35 Percent of Its Workforce in Latest Round of Staff Cuts - IGN,
I got laid off Oct . Started new job within weeks. Today I found new company I work for has been aquired. ,"Anyone of you with more lay off experience than I have, should I assume lay off coming? I have worked for companies aquired and sometimes they axe staff while  sometimes they don't. I was told we will know more in April. In 2009 I went thru 2 lay offs. It was horrific.

"You never really know, I guess"," 

When I started this week, since my EI was declined due to an error in my ROE, all the money I had in the world was in my pocket; just two $20 bills. That's it. I was immensely stressed because the job market for IT is absolutely unforgiving right now, but I had two technical assessments scheduled. If I didn't get either of these positions, I had no other options. These are the only two companies talking to me right now, and I have no other cards to play.

The first one, I felt, went fairly well, but I haven't heard back from them yet. The second test was *horrendous*! I went into it knowing that, after it, I had no other options and just absolutely bombed it. The test involved me writing code using a language in which I have years of experience and I couldn't remember how to do anything! I couldn't force my brain to work due to all of the stress!

Afterward, the company gave feedback to the recruiter, and the most unexpected thing happened. Even the recruiter, when he told me, said, ""I've been doing this for over a decade and this has never happened before."" He continued with, ""The company confirmed that you did not do well. He even said 'this guy doesn't know the language'... but he still gave you the contract. Even though there are other options, something you said or did made him believe you can still do this contract even though he doesn't believe you know the language!"" He's right, I can do this contract so I'm not concerned in accepting it but shocked about receiving it."

22M Recent grad about to be laid off any advice?,"So I am currently an entry level consultant for around a year already (ik ik, but not with mckinsey though lol) who just got put on a pip. I’m not dumb and I see the writing on the wall so I have been applying and looking for new opportunities.

Right now, I have no student loan debt, no car payment, no mortgage, and no one else to support except myself. I also have 8 months of living expenses saved up.

I currently live in a HCOL and my lease ends April, which is also when my pip ends. Should I move back with my parents? I have a good relationship with them and they are very supportive and would allow me to live rent free. The obvious answer is yes but would love to hear your thoughts. Ik the stigma is less nowadays but can’t shake off that feeling yk.

I am also quite scared since I am a recent grad and given the current climate it looks rough out there. Besides cutting back expenses, saving up, applying for more opportunities, is there anything else I should be doing. Thanks for your advice!"
Got laid off but I feel ok,"As title says I got laid off but I don’t feel bad about it. Reason for this being that my manager was treating me very poorly throughout the year to the point where I was insecure about my work, unmotivated and depressed.

He wouldn’t listen to my ideas and would even go as far as cutting me off whenever I tried to suggest an alternative implementation plan to whatever new feature we were implementing (luckily team would re-meet without him and would sometimes go with my idea).

He would also not assign any work to me during sprint plannings as he had his “guy” on the team that he would try to give pretty much every task and story he could to. Got to the point where even his guy began making comments about how he was getting too much work and feeling stressed out during retro/sprint planning calls.

He also didn’t listen to me several times when I suggested adding specific features at earlier times in the roadmap. The decision to hold off on those things ended up biting us down the line when we were constantly in “crunch time” because everything had to be done immediately. There was never any lack of man power and these were all things we were able to accomplish at any point. My manager was really bad at planning.

Finally to top it off my manager never had any control over his employees as everyone was doing whatever they wanted and didn’t consult with him about anything. This resulted in the team ending up getting a pseudo “demotion” since we were out under another team who we were previously peers to.

I wasn’t the only one the manager treated this way. Thanks for coming to my ted talk."
"""Most people use statistics like a drunk man uses a lamppost; more for support than illumination""","I guess I'll do the same.  The job market is both terrible and great right now.  Terrible for great jobs.  Great for terrible ones. 

If you happen to be looking at job numbers, or watching the news questioning your sanity about a 3.7% unemployment number, there's a lot of people that don't get counted in that number. You are not nuts. Caveat, I'm not an economist but using BLS's own numbers  


\- 6.1 million unemployed, including 1.3 million long-term unemployed (counted in 3.7% unemployment number)  
\- 4.4 million employed part time for economic reasons - more or less would prefer full time employment but can't find it...basically folks that need any job to pay the bills (NOT counted in unemployment rate stats)  
\-5.8 million million not in the labor force who currently want a job, but haven't searched in the 4 weeks prior...which would have coincided with the holidays when many people took a break (NOT counted in unemployment)  


  
How could it be that the total number of hours worked barely rose when the number of jobs grew rapidly? Simple: The growth has been in part-time jobs, which involve fewer hours.  
“All of the jobs the American economy is adding are part-time and the average workweek fell to 34.1 hours — that is recession territory!” ING’s chief international economist, James Knightley, wrote in a quick take after the jobs report

Understanding Layoffs decisions: Retaining H1B Visa employees over American citizens,"The topic I’m about to address is sensitive, but it’s crucial and needs to be discussed.

As an American citizen and a former employee at a FAANG company, I find myself in a challenging situation. Despite holding a master’s degree in engineering and having approximately 8 years of experience, I was laid off. This leads me to a pressing question that I’m struggling to understand.

Consider a scenario where two individuals are equally skilled and capable: one is a U.S. citizen, and the other holds an H1B visa. In a layoff situation, why would a company choose to retain the H1B visa employee over the American citizen, especially when both possess similar competencies or when the American employee could be trained to fill any gaps?

This question isn’t just about policies or economics; it’s about fairness, opportunity, and the underlying factors that drive such decisions in corporate America.


Looking forward to learning from other perspectives"
Should I feel bad for taking time off?,"Hi,

I was laid off in the beginning of November. I’m almost 30 (no kids or partner), and somehow this is the first time I have had a break in employement since I was in college/grad school. I always had 2-3 jobs in college, and worked through both summer and winter breaks, immediately worked after graduating, etc. Grew up poor/no financial support from parents so I didn’t have a choice. 

I’m doing well for myself now because of my savings, and have a 3 month severance. I thought I would hate the time off because I’m normally a workhorse.. but I am actually enjoying it. I find myself exploring hobbies that I never had a chance to while growing up. I finally got to take a few vacations cancelled from COVID way back when. It makes me not want to go back to work and enjoy the entire winter off. I can’t help but feel guilty for doing so. 

There have been massive layoffs in my industry and seems to be a new one every week which is making me pretty anxious. The time away from my industry also made me realize I really don’t like it lol. It pays well, but it’s the definition of corporate greed that I always said I wouldn’t partake in, but the need for money outweighed how I felt about it.

Anyone else going through this weird midlife crisis after a layoff? Or have experienced it and would like to share advice?

Thanks for reading.."

Forcefully resigned and losing hope. What do I do?,"My dad was got forcefully resigned a few months back because his position no longer exists. He was afraid of causing any trouble because it was a defense contractor company, so he thought it might mess up his security clearance. 

I know you can't get any benefits if you resign, but is there anything to do in this situation? Is there no way to get benefits? My dad is now trying to get a job, but he's growing older and older. I'm not fully integrated into the workforce yet, and I have a minimum-wage job, so I can't help carry on the family. What do we do? It feels like the greedy corporations are always winning once again while the government is turning a blind eye and just abandoning us. What do we do?"

Laid off at 39 weeks pregnant,"Hi everyone, I’m 39 weeks pregnant and will be getting laid off next week. This is such an awful situation and is coming at the worst possible time; I have worked at this company for my entire professional career. 

My department will be eliminated so unfortunately I don’t think I’ll have a legal case. Obviously I will not be getting a new job before giving birth since I am due next week so am just looking for some advice. 

I was going to get 18-20 weeks of paid maternity leave (some via short term disability and some through MA PFML) but now am not sure if I will still qualify for this as I will be losing my job. 
I am assuming I will get some severance but am wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and if you were able to negotiate at all. Ideally I would love to still get my maternity leave and then have my severance kick in after that but not sure if that is a realistic possibility. I am just really hoping for some extra time so that I can enjoy these first few months with my newborn instead of immediately rushing to find a new job. 
Thanks in advance for any advice"

Layoff and found a new job,"Hi y’all! I was laid off exactly a month ago and today I got an offer from a great company!

Heavy heart,"I got laid off in September ‘23. I’ve been optimistic the whole time dealing with this but today is a day where my heart is so heavy and all I can do is cry. It is so hard and competitive in trying to find a job. I know I am not the only one dealing with trying to find a new job.

I had an interview last Monday but no update as of today when they told me by Friday I would know of something. 

I had an interview yesterday at a different company but it’s also competitive but won’t hear back until two weeks. 

It’s been so hard to land interviews to boot!! 


Hiring managers are taking their sweet time with a decision — the experience of waiting and getting no response IMO is worse than getting a flat out no.

The only good thing is I have an understanding and patient spouse. He knows I’m trying my best and understanding the difficulty I’m going through with trying to land a new job. Other people don’t get it and think I’m not trying hard enough. :-( "
Networking and Perspective,"Been laid off multiple times working in IT. 20+ years of experience and I have never been at the same company longer than 4 yrs. Here is some advice and a way to approach a layoff.

1.  There is no loyalty and no one is safe. Ever.
2.  IT contracting (W2 hourly) is not a bad way to go.  It's not for everyone.  But it typically pays more.  And rarely do they ask you to work overtime. Because then they have keep paying you for every hour.

Also, as a contractor, you typically don't have to deal with office politics.

3. Networking.  Start now.  How?

The best way to network is to be that Connector.  Someone has a need or an interest, introduce them to someone else you know who can meet that need, or share their interest.  The more you connect people, brhe more they'll remember.  And willing to help you   It has to selfless and genuine.




4.  Have a backup, side hustle, or plan B / contingency plan.

5. These jobs are not your life.  It's just a means to make money so you can live your life.

6. Co-workers are not your friends.  Never disclose detailed personal information.  They will find a way to use it against you.

8Mo Pregnant and being laid off tomorrow - severance negotiation advice,"35 weeks pregnant and just found out I’m being laid off from a large corporate tomorrow. I learned that I’ll get some severance but nothing specific related to maternity.

My group lead has supposedly requested an extension on my severance. I’m a remote employee - based in NJ."
In case of a layoff ,"Hello,

So thankfully, I wasn’t laid off… or maybe not yet.
But just like most of us, I’m terrified of it, and sometimes I can smell it in the air.

If I was single, I wouldn’t care, I can live on eating noodles and renting a room for $500 a month.

But I’m the head of the house and a newly wed, and my wife lost her job recently.

So as a newly wed man who has extra financial responsibilities my question is, how do people financially recover from a layoff? 

I know that I should have 3-6 months of emergency fund…. But with this economy, I  barely have two.

Do people have “tips and tricks” ? Or a plan to do things ? How do you pay rent ? 

Edit: thankfully, I don’t have any large monthly payment or debt or anything.

Edit2: thank you everyone for your advice."
day 3: this slow burn is painful. i can't enjoy my weekend with my upcoming layoff on my mind,"today is the weekend. no work, no applications to be busy with so I should be relaxing. well no I can't stop thinking about my upcoming layoff. im stuck in bed and don't feel like getting up. I feel like this slow burn is torture. I just want to fast-forward to my layoff date, but then that day brings a new burden on my head and a different kind of burn. I ask myself what I did to deserve this, I worked hard, had a good attitude, but that's how victims think. I am a villain that took advantage of them is the right attitude. No matter how hard I try and no matter how many times I tell myself, I'm not a villain and the only one I'm frauding is myself when I say these things. However, I go with the act since it makes me feel better than being a victim. Victim or villain, it's only a few days away from my layoff, but it feels like an enternity... a slow burn that is torturing me."
Bad Day,"I was laid off about 3 weeks ago.

How do you all manage the tough days? "
"""Don't Worry, You'll Find Something Soon""","I was laid off a few weeks ago from a job that had been burning me out. On the one hand, I was happy to be out of that job, but on the other hand that job provided me a place of stability for the past few years. Since then I've been applying for jobs and speaking with recruiters. I've had a small handful of interviews since being laid but none have gotten to the final stage. 

I'm trying to occupy my time as best as I can while I'm looking for work (I signed up for an online course, for example), but I'm also feeling really sad and isolated. I only know one other person who is also dealing with a layoff during this time. People who are seemingly happy at their jobs have told me ""don't worry, you'll find something soon."" It's gotten to the point where I'm tired of hearing people say that, let alone hear about how much they're enjoying their job. It makes me feel even worse about not having a job. I know I'll find a job again, but it's dealing with the day-to-day feeling of not having a job right now that's weighing on me.

I know my layoff was nothing personal against me (it was a company-wide layoff) but  I'm struggling with navigating through my first layoff. I figured I would post in this subreddit and maybe there are others who can relate to this post. 

I welcome any insights, thoughts, or advice someone may have.  I work in the writing field. Sending lots of good vibes to everyone here. Thank you for reading this post. "

Let go after 4 weeks,"I was hired to be a demand planner for a small cosmetics company. They had plans to implement an MRP system and wanted me to use the software to control inventory and forecast demand. That seemed a bit ambitious given the salary, job description, and candidate requirements. The hiring process was strange to say the least. I had actually applied for a chemist position, but was asked if I’d be interested in this during the interview. Next was funneled through a recruiter (who also sits on the board) and sent a personality test (an excel file lol). Found out later that she gets a 20% recruitment fee for that sham. My interview with the manager was odd. He didn’t have many questions and let a 26 year old accountant lead the interview. I ended up getting the job. I have been trying to get into data or software engineering for awhile and was excited for anything related. The job itself was calling an erp system with SQL and manipulating that data in an excel or powerBI format. My SQL and excel skills far exceeded anyones ability at the company. I was given some data analysis work to do with almost zero guidance, expectations, support or feedback. After 4 weeks they let me go because they decided the MRP system would take longer to implement than expected. When pressed they also said the data I presented had some errors and that I wasn’t a good fit for the team. Okay, some feedback would have solved that. I never heard anything negative about my work or relationships. At least give me an opportunity to correct. Am I crazy?"

Getting tired of the same cycle (Rant),"8 years experience as an application engineer. Learned a bespoke software suite for my last company from nothing, became a subject matter expert. Laid off with salary continuation last year (offered a relocation but didn't want to move to Europe).

Been heavily applying since May 2023. Mostly remote work and some hybrid/onsite roles within the two closest major metropolitan areas. I know a little about a lot, and the lot that I know is not used outside of my former company.

What keeps happening is the interviews I do get, I progress through to the final stages. During the process I spend time familiarizing myself with as much of the stack as I can. Then, they decide to go with another candidate, one that I'm sure has proven experience in the stack they're looking for.

I express that my goal is to learn and develop more industry standard technical skills, countering with the experience I do have is navigating the technical hurdles universally experienced with clients.

I'm just getting tired of this. Roles that want me to learn don't want someone with my experience. Roles that want my experience want me to already know their stack. I'm feeling trapped in my situation, coming up on a year without a job. The war chest I saved preparing for this eventuality is starting to diminish. What a terrible time to be unemployed in tech."
Casualty of Activision/Microsoft mass layoff last Thursday,Just wanted to gripe. Thank you for reading. I will share any tips or tricks I learn as I navigate the job search minefield.
Routine post layoff,"I just got laid off in December right before the holidays. I’m now full force looking for a new job. Honestly I was pretty miserable at my job and want to make sure I keep upbeat mentally during the job hunt. Right now I don’t have a routine and want to have a good one where I can sleep to a reasonable time and workout besides interviewing, applying and networking. Anyone have a good routine? The first couple of days I’ve slept late, stayed in PJs, ate at random times and have not worked out."
Layoff,"I got a temporary lay off from my job this past week and it was very devastating for me since I really enjoyed the job, it was good money, it had benefits I’ve never had before with any other job and the people were very nice including that is was only a 22min walk to the work place from my apartment building. From the time I found out at the end of the day until the time I got home I was crying so much, I’ve worked so hard thinking I was going to get my bonus and my profit share from the company and as soon as my benefits kick in this all happens. It’s going to be hard finding a new job in the mean time since it’s around the holidays and most companies have there seasonal workers by now. I applied for EI this week so that will help a bit for the mean time until I find a new job. 😔 it may be temporary and they could call me back but it’s no promises, keeping my hopes up but not too high."
I've joined the layoff gang,"Was hoping to go out on my terms, but I saw this coming 3 months ago. Luckily I've got some irons in the fire already, and 2 months of severance. Fingers crossed.

Gives me some time to study for some certs and play some video games :)"
Gut feeling I'm next,"Yearly review is right around the corner,
Company is tightening up spending,
Managers are nitpicking every little thing that isn't perfect in my work all of the sudden.

Please God no. I don't want to go through this again. I've finally saved up money and now I might have to burn through it all. Praying that I'm paranoid and can continue this job. Will post update after review ."
6 month severance good?,Worked there for 4 years and 4 months. Overall positive remote experience. Should I talk to a lawyer and try to get more or is this a good offer?
Had interview scheduled,"I had an interview scheduled for tomorrow but got an email this morning saying that they have already hired someone else. While I’m not happy, that’s the world today."
The good old days…,We have experienced abrupt job loss before but this time feels different. Tech is the most unstable it’s been in a long time. It feels like that’s it for stability in our lives. No more work from home. Less pay. Worst job title. I don’t know what our family is going to do and I’m really sad and angry. SAHM goes back to work. Kids go to daycare and aftercare full time. Commutes hours long. If we are even lucky enough to find jobs. It feels like a bad dream.

Layoff Lemonade 🍋- Turn your layoff into a positive!,"I created Layoff Lemonade 🍋 for a personal reason:    

To not feel alone.    

I was laid off from my corporate tech job in December. The immense loneliness hit me like a ton of bricks. Overnight, I was forced to leave my former co-workers and shed that community.    

Often it happens without warning. You're left out in the cold.    

And I don't want anyone else who's been laid off to feel this way.     

So I started a weekly newsletter called Layoff Lemonade to give you hope during a tough time. It's filled with uplifting stories and actionable advice designed to propel you forward (even if you just want to watch Netflix and eat Cheetos all day!). 

As a former Lead Tech Recruiter (top NYC healthtech/fintech/consulting), I have a unique take on the job market having experienced it both from the hiring team and the candidate's point of view. And I want to share those learnings to help you with your job search!

Now you can have a new community. You're not alone anymore! 🍋

Am I being laid off? 🙂,"Just FYI - I’m using a throwaway account

I recently returned to work after about 16 weeks of short term leave. My “end of year performance discussion” has been rescheduled about 2 or 3 times since I’ve returned. Not really sure why I’m having a review since I’ve been out for so long anyways. Anyways, I have been suspect of some things going on internally since I’ve returned. My review was supposed to be today, but was rescheduled for later on this week with no reason why. Out of curiosity, I happened to look at my HR partners calendar and she has an event blocked at the same time as my “end of year performance discussion” that was rescheduled for later this week. Interestingly enough, my HR partner is out of office today, when my performance discussion was supposed to take place. BTW, I think “end of year performance discussion” is a really weird calendar invite name lol. 

Am I looking too much into things or should I be concerned about a layoff? Thanks so much!

Update: Got rescheduled yet again, it’s now next week 🙃 now they want me to fill out the end of year self review…but i was only there for about 6 months and then out for 4 months so i pushed back. The week i went out i wrote my mid year review and never heard anything about it…so i said my answers are the same, look at that document. Still pretty sure im being let go and this is HR covering bases. HR rep has a calendar block at the new time too 🙂"

How’s your emergency fund looking - if you work in tech?,"Just wondering what everyone’s emergency fund is looking like these days, as tech gets demolished by layoffs?

Previously was saving to help my fiance pay off her student loans once we’re married but obviously holding onto that $$$ now - seeing my company is currently being bought out by private equity and no one is safe. 

I have about 14-16 months of expenses saved right now, but worry that’s not enough if we’re on the precipice of a major recession. Suppose I could always sell my car if shit hits the fan in the future. 

What’s everyone else’s situation looking like?"
You win employers. I'm out.,"After wasting 10 years of my life working at mega corps and startups in the telecom/tech industry I'm truly done with this game. Been laid off since August with zero promising leads. Even jobs that pay half of my last salary aren't responding. If this is how they want to play it, fine. I'm learning to become an electrician and plan to work for myself on a need basis. I also plan to consult using my tech experience but not building up hope that it will pan out. All I see is my taxable income plummiting and my interest in participating in this fucked economy non-existent. If things don't turn around I plan to fully leave the US for cheaper and easier lifestyle abroad. This current economy/hiring practices aren't sustainable. Something will break and I refuse to be the one stuck with all the pieces trying to bailout previous and future generations.

You win. You taught me a lesson. You put me in my place. Useless execs and clueless product people making bank with all the job security in the world while the actual engineers aren't even able to find a new job. It's a sick joke and I don't want to be part of it anymore. 

The economy is only getting worse, people's moods are only getting worse. We are actively seeing the social/economic/whatever you want to call it of our society being torn to shreds and nothing is being done to protect us. 

The government has endless funds for war and corporate welfare but refuse to support it's citizens needs and protect us. 

Without massive reforms and a huge 180 by employers, I'm convinced we are heading for a terrible ride. Get out if you can. "
"Those who have been laid off, what support would you want from former co-workers","Just survived a round where I work - some of the ones who didn't were people I'd consider friends.  Would you want to hear anything from the people who'd been left over, or would you want to be left alone to process?  Want to be as supportive as I can, but not sure how."
If u have been laid off comment below and explain if it was random or told to you months ahead,Gucci gang
Some “Recruiters” Ask for SSN- Don’t Give It,"Just a reminder that it is VERY easy for scammers to prey on desperate job seekers. One thing to know is that legit recruiters will NEVER ask for your SSN or birthday on a first call. I’ve calmly but firmly said, I would be happy to provide this if there is an offer and need to do a background check.

Typically for corporate roles, this will be after at least 1-2 phone calls and interviews. A written offer should be sent to you via email. And for a background check, most employers typically use a third party service. Also HR would need this. But if they ask for it on the first phone call and you refuse, they should respect it. If they don’t, chances are it’s a scam. Or a really crappy employer.

If you feel it might be worth testing if it is legit, provide a fake date of birth and fake SSN or even fake last 4 if they ask. Then later they’ll have you fill out paperwork anyway and you’d have to verify your info. You can always change it at that time.

Beware of scammers during this vulnerable time! Stay safe and healthy!

Also, if you can, use an email for your resume, contact etc. that is completely separate from any email associated with your bank account/other important personal accounts. Have different password for these emails too."
Laid off dreams,"Was laid off in the Fall got a new job quick. As in within  6 days.  Then full time job went part time due to the economy . I had a dream of doing my old job. An incredible sadness came over me, missing what I used to do upon waking.  I had no idea how hard the loss of my old job had hit me till this morning. In my dream my whole identity was doing my old job... For years you go in to the same place, do your thing then one day it's poof as if it was nothing. The ppl you saw everyday they fade out like characters in a movie once the movie is over. How long till this sappy phase passes?"
"For those who were laid off after an acquisition, how long after the acquisition did it take for you to get laid off?",My startup company I worked for a few years was acquired by a bigger company in 2021. I am still safe and so far my entire team is as well. No layoffs have been heard of since the acquisition. Just trying to get a feel for how long it might take to happen since I hear acquisition layoffs are very common.
9 months later and still haven’t processed layoff,"TL;DR
Worked at org for 8 years. 
Built section of dept from scratch; became director year 6.
Excellent reviews for 7 years.
New manager for year 7.
Bad review beginning of year 8.
Took leave for family illness.
New CEO started while gone. 
Was laid off 3 days after I returned with 15% of company.

Since then I’ve grown my business to be successful enough to be my “9-5” but anytime I have a bad client interaction I go back to the trauma of being laid off.

Perfect example: I lost a client in December because of restructuring of their dept and I haven’t recovered mentally. What do you all do to get back on the horse? I’m trying every day to do a little in hopes the rhythm returns and I’ve lost it all."

Advice - Never Give Up - Never Let Them Define You,"To a lot of you.  This is your first layoff.  Just because it is the first time happening to you does not mean this is unprecedented.

For Gen-X. Many of us have not had longevity with a single employer. 

We've endured multiple layoffs and downturns from the Wall Street Crash in the late 80s to the dotcom crash that was compounded by 9/11 to the real estate crash and other mini recessions in between.

Here are some insights I hope can help.

1. I believe in you.
2. I have faith in you 
3. You can do this.
4. You are stronger than you know.
5.  Believe in yourself, If you don't no one else will.  You got this.

That said.  Recessions/downturns are not easy.  You are going to have to fight for it.  Find a way. Get creative, innovate, pivot, think outside the box, etc.

Never stop applying.  Even if you're already working.  No one is safe. Ever.

You should be moving up, or moving on every 2-3 years.  Because at some point, you will hit a plateau and that's where you'll stay.

Networking.  There's more to networking than LinkedIn.  And this part is not easy for those who are introverted.  But the more you help people, the more likely people are to help you.  Referrals are a great way to accomplish this. Can you recommend someone to somebody?

Go to networking events.  And I know it's not easy.  Bring a wingman /wingperson.  That way you can introduce each other when meeting new people.  Also, having a wingperson gives you someone to talk to instead of standing around by yourself.

Pick 5-10 target companies that are hiring that you want to work for.  Now try to find someone who can introduce you to an executive who works there and see if you can get introduced.

Find an executive and invite them to coffee (maybe lunch).  For the purpose of advice.  Let them know you are interested in their company / industry and would like to pick their brain on what insights they can give you.

Looking for a job should be a full-time job.  That doesn't mean apply for jobs 8 hours a day, but a combination of efforts.

Utilze local job clubs in your area.  Most are located in big metropolitan areas.  These are free.  They'll have guest speakers can yelp with resumes, etc.  

If you are out of work, sign up for temp agencies.  Also take a look at Craiglist for side gigs to earn extra cash.  But be careful as some of those are scams.

Try to find jobs where you can network and / or be around those of influence.  For example, go be a locker-room attendant at a country club.  Maybe try to get a job as a valet.  Not only do you get to meet wealthy people who might be able to pull strings for you, but yiu'll get good tips too.  Or be a golf caddy.

Look for hidden industries  / companies no one thinks about.

Pivot.  For example, if you are in Sales.  See if any of your competitors are hiring, maybe establish a rapport with them so when they are ready to hire again, you are at the top of the list.

What about Vendors?. Do they need salespeople?

Or become an independent commissioned only sales rep and represent a portfolio of of companies.  This way you work for yourself. And the companies you represent don't have to keep you on a payroll.  They simply pay you if you make a sale."
It's not just Layoffs,
Laidoff for the 2nd time in 2 years,"Laidoff after 6 months in August 2023. Got a new job within 1 month. (I should have taken the first offer but mistakes happen)  
Now Laidoff again after 1.5 years. (US/remote/saas) 

My rebound job was awful. Our 20 person, 17 year start up was truly torture… 

I knew from the start this company was untrustworthy as the entire marketing team up to the director was less than 1.5 years tenure. 
I never expected to stay at this company, the only reason I didn’t quit/look for a better position was because I didn’t want to look like a job hopper. But due to the company’s history. I have socking away extra cash.

Now going to the Philippines, Japan, and Korea before pimping out my soul again."
Laid off early 2023. Ran out of benefits. What jobs can I pursue? (I’m a dev),"tldr; What jobs can I pursue besides DoorDash/Uber/blue collar jobs? Something intersecting with tech. Maybe solutions engineer? Or something less savvy. It doesn’t matter at this point. I just need something…but I feel clueless as to what I can do with my technical chops. Might have to just swallow my pride and do something completely different. 

6.5 YOE. Fullstack dev. Compsci degree. No FAANG exp but have interesting background and exp. Laid off early 2023. Got a severance package. 

Was living with family and have inheritance that I could live off of. So I wasn’t in dire need to get a job right away. So I decided to pursue something I had been working on, full time. 

It’s been a year since I got laid off now. Haven’t launched my SaaS app yet. So have yet to gauge PMF. 

I’m out of benefits and need to pay bills for my car and a few other things. 

I’ve been able to get a lot of interviews due to my experience but I’m just not the best interviewer and on top of that, the market is really bad. Took a break working on my idea last Nov. and have not been able to secure a job. Had one final round last week and it went well but they went with someone else. 

What are some other jobs I can pursue? Worst case, I know I can DoorDash/Uber. But I’m thinking maybe Solutions Engineer. Something in tech."

New Job after 3 months of nothing - 3 offers at the table right now,"So i was laid off in Dec 2023 with 1 month of severance. I was in technical accounting as was getting $130k base as a supervisor.

After 3 really difficult months of hopeless searches i now got 3 offers on my table:

1) SEC Reporting Senior -$115k - Said preliminary YES.

2)  Technical Accounting Manager in Advisory - $140k 

3) Technical Accounting Manager in Advisory - $135k

&#x200B;

I said the 1st compnay my pleliminary Yes since they were the 1st ones and really pushed through all processes. They are also willing to sponsor my H1B (same as all other companies).

What i am worried about is that advisory market is kinda dead and nobody knows what's going to happen in 2024. I do not personally see sig IPO's or SPAC's. And i don't want to appear in the same situation a year from now, as there will be no projects for all people.

&#x200B;

I hate routine and i feel like it will become really boring for me relatively quickly.

Need Advice. Performance review didn’t go well. HR was also part of call. Am I getting laid off?,"My mid year review was to take place in mid-dec was pushed to feb that too on my insistence. My manager and skip manager have pointed out dissatisfaction on my performance. The HR was also a part of the discussion. They have suggested me to focus on power BI project but they haven’t even given something substantial also more like we will see types but at the same time they are also saying we will see how you perform in this in next 1 month. Also have acknowledged that I don’t do the grunt work better. But along with the power bi project I have been given this grunt level work of testing the tables which is such a grunt level task. 
They have also set up fortnightly review. Last year my immediate colleague was also put on pip in may was let go off eventually. I want to know you guys experience. Am I in the same boat?

Should I be honest with my manager how worried I am?,"I’ve been with the company for 11 months. LOVE THE JOB. I’ve been job hopping 5 jobs the past 4 years for very valid reason and one being a contract and one had to relocate. Anyways, we’re in the wholesale industry and do finance and it’s a pretty big company. I admit, I know I should be worried when we closed like 10 of our warehouses in the past year and we’re about to close 4 more in the spring. We’ve hired consultants plus I’ve had senior managers I work with get laid off after over 10-20 years of service. There’s been 5 of them laid off in the past 4 months. I have my quarterly review tomorrow and I want to bring up how worried I am. This will obviously raise some flags for him that I might leave but then, should I even say anything? I’ll just leave when I find a new job? Our senior director said he’s not worried about us losing our jobs since we’re pretty crucial as a finance department but they literally let go the accounting manager. The reason I’m in a debacle is because I actually love this job and it’s the best job I’ve had. I’ve never felt respected like this at a workplace before and I have so much respect that I can’t just blindside my boss. Should I say anything?

EDIT: thank you all! I didn’t tell him about my concerns but I brought up promotions and growth. I made another post if you want to read it! "
You're not a good fit with our team,"I haven't been officially laid off yet, but today, the partners on my team had a meeting with me saying I'm not a good fit with their team. This caught by by surprise as I thought I was doing a good job. They said they're not terminating me and that I should explore other areas in the company. This is basically  pushing me to voluntarily resign so they don't have to pay unemployment. I plan to meet with the higher up tomorrow and ask them to either 1) move be to a different department within the company, or 2) terminate/lay me off. Not sure if that's the best route, what do you guys think?"

"What, If Anything, Can Be Done?","Boom Bust Repeat  We all know what happens during the ‘bust’.  But can anything be done to improve the situation?

The issue is bigger than any one of us. We have no leverage. Businesses are in complete control. 

Some financial professionals advise having an Emergency Fund of 3-6 months expenses. Some have that. Some don’t. 

In general, these days 6 months is not enough for an Emergency Fund. Companies laying off are doing little hiring. And things usually do not turn around in 6 months. 

Is there anything that can be done? I don’t think so. Please prove me wrong."
Keep Your Head Up,
Severance ,"Why do companies offer severance? It can't be to attract and retain people, because it only happens when they let people go. What's in it for them?"
Wanna be your own boss?,"Hello all talented laid off folks. I have been wondering if there is a place or community where we can collaborate to start our own business.

Modern Day Gold Rush?,"Far too many people get lured into tech with dreams of becoming rich. Like myself.  We learn about the boom and gut wrenching bust cycles. But that causes few of us to leave.

The truth is very few ever truly get rich.  Not much different than the 1848 California Gold Rush. Very few miners got rich.  Those selling supplies did well. 

In today’s tech culture we see much the same. Very few get rich. Those selling all type of job search services are making a good income and even getting rich. 

For fiscal year 2023 LinkedIn reportedly made $15B. Cultivating a tech user base anxious about their jobs. Others looking to sell someone something. 

Take a look at LinkedIntoJobs. An organization selling services to those trying to find a job. A market needing to be served. And if you gain something from their services more power to you. Didn’t work for me. Later I discovered one piece of advice was likely detrimental to my effort. Lost opportunities. 

Is the modern day tech worker a figurative descendent of the gold miner? IMO interesting arguments can be made for and against. 

Make no mistake though.  A healthy stream of money can be had selling all manner of employment services to a worried tech worker. 

Exploitation or good business?"
FSA advice - especially early in the year,"You may not know this, but most employers make your full FSA balance available to you at the beginning of the year and then collect throughout the year. 

If you are laid off, you will lose all money in your FSA when your benefits end (if you extend with cobra, you may still be able to use them - YMMV). 

If your employer has not been able to collect the amount of your dedications and you spend it all - guess what? Not your problem. Your employer is on the hook for paying it themselves.

And now, a story 😂:

My employer laid me off on Jan 9 2023 with zero notice and zero severance. My benefits ended at midnight. I had $2850 in my FSA and hadn’t made one payment yet as we hadn’t been paid in 2023 yet.

I called my doc and asked for 3 month refills. Did the same for my high risk kid. Went into Walgreens and waited for them, used my FSA card to pay.

Next, I Rolled into Costco, bought 5 pairs of prescription Gucci sunglasses and regular glasses using my benefits and used my FSA card for the rest.

I calculated what was left and then rolled into the pharmacy section and bought multiples of whatever we needed over the next year that was marked as FSA eligible. You have to pay at the pharmacy and you have to make sure your total stays under what you have in the account. The pharmacist was skeptical but I was calculating as I shopped and stayed 37 cents under my available FSA balance.

My FSA balance went from $2850 to $0.37 cents in 2 hours and my employer got one payroll deduction from me of $100.

The best part is they’ll be on the hook for what I spent that they hadn’t collected yet.

I joke that my severance was in glasses, bandaids, NyQuil and tampons but fuck them. That’s what they deserve."
Is the growing sub count of this sub a canary in the coal mine ?,"Obviously not everyone uses Reddit but I joined this sub a week or two ago and it was just at or under 11,000 followers. It’s grown to 13,000+ in that time frame. This represents approximately a 20% increase. Is this sub a canary in the coal mine ? 

I think things are getting way worse before they get better. Inflation is a nation killer and inflation from 2021 to now has hurt the majority of Americans and businesses. Sure inflation is down from its peak of 7-8% to now around 4% but that’s been compounded over the years. What used to cost $1 is now $1.20. 

It appears that printing and giving out unchecked PPE loans , multiple rounds of Covid stimulus and most importantly the inflation reduction act (how fucking comical they named it this lol) actually cause inflation not reduce it.

Let’s start a new chant, “no matter who never blue !”"

How do I minimize the likelihood of getting laid off?,"Apologies if this has already been asked before. I’m an embedded software engineer with 3 YOE, about to join a big company in the Bay Area in June on an H1B visa. I’ve been on this sub for the past month and have been feeling anxious consistently (that one’s on me). 

I want to make sure that I do everything in my power to minimize the probability of getting laid off, without getting bogged down in cynicism and paranoia. What advice would you give to someone about to join a company? What are the best practices? What are the warning signs? "
Fired for poor performance (documented) but without cause? What gives?,"In June I took what I perceived to be a dream job with a dream company. It involved significant international travel and responsibility - as well as a significant pay increase. I was on cloud 9. 

What ensued was one of the most prolific meltdowns I'd ever experienced in my 12 year career. Despite multiple attempts I simply could not get the hang of things (reasoning irrelevant). The frustration led to mistakes, which led to delays and very unhappy management. We tried for over 6 months to work through things, (my boss was very open and receptive) however it all culminated in a PIP in November, and being fired in the middle of December. There were verbal and written warnings along the way (which referenced chapter and verse the policies which governed individual performance). I had numerous deep talks with my boss about what I thought was going on but in the end I never tried to pawn off that I was responsible for my performance. I never felt the need to blame others or pass the buck. I simply was broken and absolutely dumbfounded about how things were going and losing steam fast. 

Much to my surprise - at the meeting where I was terminated, I was then told it was because of lack of fit for the job. No mention of performance, warnings, pip or any of that. This was a complete surprise to me.  I can only attribute this to a move orchestrated by my boss to soften the blow. I asked the HR rep point blank if this meant that I wouldn't be able to work there again to which she replied that I was certainly eligible for rehire and if I saw a position I was qualified for to re-apply.  

**For those in HR or with some knowledge of how these things go - was this sort of a best case scenario? This has never happened to me before in over a dozen years of professional working so I have zero insights. With all the warnings and poor performance (all heavily documented) - they had more than enough ammo to label me as derelict and by my assumption black list me. Any insights would be great. Thank you all for reading my post.** "
Laid off in November,I have been laid off from tech since November from a start up and before that I worked in a big enterprise level companies. I live in Canada and it's been 2 months with job search and no final offer. I have been ghosted after final rounds. Everyday it's same applying all day long. The rest of the time I focus on household work and taking care of 4 yr old. Never have been in a difficult situation professionally. Before coming to Canada I worked for 7 years in USA. How are other people doing with finding new jobs in Canada specially in tech sector? Are you getting handful number of calls for the tech roles? I am into product management.

Congressional hearing abt unemployment,"https://youtu.be/H6ZfjixCDMw?si=qm1N-S25HsqTqT68

Skip to 11:00 in. 

This is a long-form hearing but part of it is a discussion abt raising unemployment rate to try to impact hyperinflation. 
If I interpret this correctly it sounds like the fed or government or decision makers have directed the corporate world  to do job cuts to help reduce inflation. 

It's like governmrnt saying:  ""ok guys, you're gouging consumers(voters)too much with your high prices. Theyre complaining and its an election year."" 

Company:"" but my company only made 50 billion last quarter instead of 60. How can i lower prices?""

Government: "" ok but voters need to afford food to eat.""

Company: "" ok, I'll cut my labor costs so I can maintain a super profit."" 

Government:"" ok, sounds good. Whatever."" 

Am I missing something and why is it acceptable to manipulate hyperinflation thru labor tweaking?? 

Suspicion:
The government and the corps work together to screw workers instead of finding other ways to cut costs. Either way the working class gets screwed. Hyperinflation or laid off. This country is run by evil clowns."

Advice to management: A little thought experiment on how business will be with low employee loyalty.,"Employees in the U.S saw that there is no real job security. Even if they performed well and the economy, according to the government and the media is strong as ever they may get laid off by the thousands due to ""restructuring / down sizing/ right sizing / short sighting / pants rising /   "", because the company wants to invest in a new technology which doesn't require workers (hypotactically/ untested / bs  ) or because the whole company derped and hired thousands of people by mistake.

Half a million tech workers on top of that newly added finance and media workers realize that their employers who greeted them with cheese and crackers in the morning really didn't give two flying f\*\*ks about them. These workers struggled for months to find an other job while they woke up every morning  to see more layoffs on the news but no news about any action to mitigate the damage. Government says that their lay off is insignificant compared to all the jobs added in total.. these jobs don't apply to him/her/they/them/it but it is fine, if they can just look at the bigger picture everything is fine. Media is onboard , his fellow neighbors are also fine with it because they have seen how lavishly tech workers were ""working"" (or rarely working) from a post where the ""influencer"" screwed around and did noting all day. They deserve to be laid off. Even Hasan the ultra left millionaire thinks that they were over paid.

Eventually, if everything doesn't go to shit completely. These people find a job. They know that they can be laid off in a heart beat for any number of reasons. There is no safety net, no one would shed a tear. So, just like the CEO that let them go to get a bigger bonus, they look for short term gains.

As the CEO you'll hire a guy for your company.. within 2 weeks they will hop on to a start up which pays a little better, then you'll need to rehire and retrain some other guy (more money out the window). Meanwhile  your current employees gets into arguments regularly to secure their positions. Your inbox is filled with complaints. They can not work together because everyone is trying to one up each other. Your junior employee is stepping over your senior engineer to show off, your senior engineer is backstabbing his junior. In a month they hop on to a job in Netherlands which provides more stability and more job security due to labor laws in Netherlands.

How the f\*\*k are you going to do business in the U.S under these conditions? You will offshore of course.. The problem is you are not alone,   the cost of hiring offshore will only increase and the quality will only decrease due to high demand. Just like microchips, you will not be able to ship any product without these external resources. And just like microchips it will take a lot of time until you reestablish the resource you screwed domestically due to your greed.

Sometimes you have to be able to lose money or in other words invest  to ensure that you will have the resources to operate.   Current lay offs are not an evidence of lack of talent but a lack of leadership and vision."

Was I laid off or fired?,"Hi there,
Experiencing some mean girl antics at my job and just wanted to ask a question for my own peace of mind. It’s common knowledge at this new job that I was “laid off” from my previous role because I was upfront about it during my job interview. However, I now have mean girls at work trying to passive aggressively imply that I was “fired”, and I’d love to know your opinion. Here are the details:

1. I was told that my last working day was the day I had the meeting with the CEO and HR, but that I would be paid until the end of the month. 
2. I was told explicitly during the meeting that it didn’t have anything to do with my performance, and was offered a healthy severance package. 
3. I was able to apply, and receive unemployment, which confirms that I wasn’t “fired with cause” otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to. 
4. There were at least 4 other people that were let go with me, and they were not offered other positions within the organization, but there was one person who’s job was eliminated and who was offered a different position in a different department. 

This last point is what these mean girls are trying to use against me. Essentially, they’re implying that I was fired because I wasn’t given the same opportunity as the woman that was offered a different role in a different department. As a note, my last organization recently reposted a few position (one at my previous pay grade), but they didn’t repost my job position. 

I wasn’t a good fit for the organization; I am relieved to no longer be there, and I feel that I ultimately “won” because I left with a healthy amount of savings in my 403b, a nice severance, and a recommendation from the CEO, and former Chief of Staff. However, the implication that I was “fired” is annoying me. I know that I’ll never truly know (they may have said it was a “layoff” and gave me severance to keep me from suing, but really used it as an opportunity to fire me—idk lol), but I’d love y’all’s opinion.  Do you think I was fired or laid off?

As a side note: We pay into unemployment every paycheck, so never feel ashamed to use it (no matter what your circumstances are)! Also, keep going; it was hard to suddenly lose a job, but I channeled that energy into finding a new role, and did within 2 weeks. I’m not saying that will be everyone’s experience, but don’t let this get you down. You got a job before, and you’ll get one again. Also, fuck bullies; they’re so miserable, and misery loves company. Please be kind to others; remember: people who are at peace within themselves aren’t mean. 🖤"
When the company that let you go then sends a robo-text that they’re hiring…,No joke.  Sent a screenshot to my recruiter friend who is still there who was having a bad day and needed a laugh.  The best part?  It was sent from a person who doesn’t exist…
"Our company is hiring consultants to help us strategize to make operations more effective, should I be worried?","Recently, our company sent a company wide email asking employees to voluntarily “retire” and get their severance pay. This was for anyone that worked over 5 years. We have closed down a couple of our warehouses and consolidated them to existing ones. This past year, corporate had to sacrifice their annual salary increases from 3-5% down to 1-2% so we can give way to our warehouse employees. Understandable but wtf? Anyways, I only got a 1% raise since I was fairly new when the raises occurred but not sure what the next raise would look like. Our senior director that has worked for the company over 40 years said our department (finance) has nothing to worry about and if layoffs would happen, we’d be the last ones to be let go. 

Anyways, we started hiring consultants to help us with our operations etc because our biggest competitor is Amazon and most of our clients are drop shippers so it’s not good. I saw another Reddit post that they hired consultants and if he should worry about it. Should I worry about it? I’ve been here less than a year and been job hopping for over 4 years and I really don’t want to go look for another one."

> Office  
>  
>**The national office vacancy rate rose 40 bps to a record-breaking 19.6%, shattering the previous record of 19.3% set twice previously:** once in 1986 driven by a five-year period of significant inventory expansion and the other in 1991 during the Savings and Loans Crisis.

>The retail sector remained largely steady throughout 2023 as **the vacancy rate stayed flat** at 10.3% in Q4. Asking rents rose by 0.2% to $21.7/sqft while effective rents were up by 0.2% to $19/sqft in Q4.  
>  
>Industrial (Warehouse/Distribution Center)  
>  
>The industrial sector enjoyed exceptional growth over the past few years, driven in part by the continued strength of e-commerce as a share of total retail sales and the impact of manufacturing reshoring and nearshoring initiatives. Construction ramped up quickly since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in response to intense demand. The annual rate peaked at 283 million sqft by mid-2023. **As the market grew more in balance, construction starts slowed amid higher interest rates and cooling demand.** 

**Summary:**

1. **Office vacancy at highest in history.**
2. Retail rental vacancy flat.
3. Industrial /warehouse vacancy tapered off.

Is this a new scam going in USA ?,Are these jobs genuine ? Anyone made any money
Employers sending me to be on PIP,"

Need input on my situation-
I am a junior BA. My employee put me on PIP a week after I switched my health plan from a cheap individual plan to a much more expensive family coverage. I have no idea how much more my employer had to pay for premium, but my contribution went up 10x. 

I have always got good reviews from my manager and suddenly I am being told I  going on PIP for unsatisfactory performance. It feels like this PIP is just a legal cover for them wanting to get rid of me. My manager’s comments in review meetings are non-comital and shows really no interest in improving anything. Sucks, but it’s what it is.

Questions:

   1. Is this even legal? I feel like I gave them the legal cover by accepting PIP instead of quitting and challenging my termination
2. In terms of not screwing up my chances with my next potential employer, should I resign before the PIP ends so my departure might be labeled voluntary. I don’t know if this voluntary vs involuntary termination is relevant in today’s economy. I know I have to explain this in my screening calls with my future employers, but I don’t know if these sorts of things come up during background checks."

Feeling a little hopeless,"Yes. Another post about being laid off. I’ve worked in tech for ten years as a systems engineer (requirements and docs) and risk manager and looking at LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, etc. it’s looking bad. I have experience at NASA and a DoD contractor, but don’t think that’ll help me. I wouldn’t mind doing anything else, but don’t know how my skills transfer. I guess I’m looking for advice that isn’t updating my resume per position to include key words and ideas for jobs to look for that could use what experience I have. "
Laid off to hire a friend,"This is a bit of a vent. I'm pretty sure I'm being laid off so that my boss can hire his friend. This is my first real job, and it's at a tiny startup. I started several months ago. Midway through, an employee who's been here a couple of years was laid off due to ""position no longer required"" and his responsibilities were given to an intern. A week later, our boss hired his friend into a different role. 

I was just told they don't have the resources to keep me on board, but then I learned they have the resources to re-hire someone who worked here a few years ago who seems to also have a good relationship with the boss. 

None of these people are incompetent in any way and are in fact more experienced in the industry than most of the current employees including me, but employees who are performing well shouldn't be replaced so easily. 

Prior to me joining there was also a lot of turnover, people getting hired then fired within months for no apparent reason. About 50% of employees in the startup are replaced every year. I knew about this and so wasn't completely caught off guard, but this is still my only role on my resume in this industry, and this is my dream industry, so I'm heartbroken. "
When do you think layoffs will taper off?,I don’t think I’m in immediate danger of layoffs but every day I see another news article about it. Does anyone think that at least by 2025 it’ll get better?
Truth behind jobs numbers,"No there isn’t a mass conspiracy behind the job numbers, but America is undergoing a transition for the worse because of high wages.

Companies such as Kaiser have taken over a large proportion of our medical system and are working to quickly develop a more profitable healthcare system. With the higher wages demanded by registered nurses, these hospitals are focusing on reduced hiring and layoffs off registered nurses in favor of support nurses such as nurses aides and lpn nurses and the responsibilities of these support nurses is pushing the line of being out of their scope of practice, ie LPN nurses taking on duties only to be performed by an RN.

Likewise as these corporations have taken over hospitals they have been undergoing massive “restructuring” ie employee layoffs and re-hiring new RN employees at substantially lower hourly rates than previous for the position.

Healthcare makes up a large proportion of the jobs data and Kaiser has been on a tear buying up practices, gutting them, and pushing limits of scope of practice over the past few months and likely will keep on rolling. You won’t officially see many layoffs reported because they are working under the guise of “restructuring”. 

As for retail services jobs, look no further than staples, retail companies are laying off employees or forcing them to reduce to part time and bringing in new part time employees. The reason for this is simple, part time workers are typically paid less, don’t receive benefits, and have a much more difficult job unionizing. 

As for government job listings, yes they are booming. Everybody hates government positions now, the pay is barely minimum wage, benefits are awful and workers are quitting in droves.

So yes the job numbers are real, but the fed and market analysts aren’t giving the whole story behind the numbers."
🔗 YAHOO.COM | Google lays off hundreds of employees in advertising team,
hopelessly grinding to find a way to pay rent post-layoff,"TL;DR - Seeking advice, connections, or just hope

I was laid off after 2 months working at a company, which feels quite embarrassing but I had been applying to new jobs since my first week because I saw the signs of a volitle company.  I'm 23, graduated college early, had a little over 2 years working experience in project management before trying out grad school to hopefully get a salary increase. I ended up withdrawing from my degree because the ROI was not literally impossible (professors and advisors telling me with the degree I'd have to start entry again and be lucky to make more than my previous salary). Luckily, I found another PM job and after 2 months was able to save a 2-month emergency fund. Now, my fund is up. I have over 70 applications out, have interviewed 4 times this month, done the recruiter calls and posting to my Linkedin network, tried Blind referrals, resume workshops, and working toward my CAPM cert, and it all just feels impossible. There are so many qualified workers out there and none of us can find anyone to take a chance on us. I'm not sure what else I can do at this point, but I'm all ears for any suggestions. "
Add Snapchat to the list,
One of my biggest worries is my 401k and not having a job anymore to continue saving for retirement,"I am always in despair over the idea of being laid off and not being able to continue contributing to my 401k. It's why I am trying hard to put as much in now when I am young so I don't have to worry about it as much when I am older.

Thoughts like the frustration of switching 401ks over to a new employer eat at me. Can't believe they send you a physical check in the mail worth 10 or 100s of thousands of dollars, just for you to mail it to your new employer.

Resume fatigue,"Vent. Toughest job market in my career to date. I keep revamping resume for key words and highlight accomplishments and tying back to job description but nothing. It’s crazy to think 1-2 yrs ago I was able to get callbacks with my resume but after getting laid off last fall, nothing. Have good references from my bosses, pivoted from accounting to compliance. I can’t change my past titles but a lot of my acctg work is transferable to compliance. I hate acctg and don’t want to go back. I’ve helped countless of others with resumes and get callbacks. I’ve downloaded resume samples, used ChatGPT, career coach to make resume better. I’ve let headhunters know I’m looking but they don’t have jobs in my area and I’m not relocating. I’m getting so tired of revamping resume I feel like I have no idea who I am now or what I’m presenting. Such a bad time to be laid off. :-(. Feeling sad and fatigued. In solidarity with everyone else who’s doing all they can to land a job. Awful awful time."
Personal layoff speedrun record - 10 days! Achievement unlocked.,"Long story short; I'm from EU, applied to a prominent IT tech company from US, remote role, in early January, went through 5 rounds of interviews (each about an hour long) with the team, test assignment, background check, and lastly the video call with the CEO.

Got onboarded in late February, given access to their sensitive files, met my team etc. and on the 3rd day of work, we get in a zoom call with the entire product team management (5 people) plus the CEO, and the CEO gives an hour long intro to the project we should start working on, and welcomes me to the company, and says, quote, looking forward seeing your work and you can ping me on slack at any time with any question or work related stuff.

Since I already had some brief work done and wanted to make a good impression, after that zoom call that's exactly what I did, sent my work link to the CEO in slack. Got some short feedback on it in 10 minutes.

Next day, my team manager calls me angry as shit asking me how dare I go behind his back to the CEO, freezes anything I work on, and few days later sacks me from the position.

Now that was FAST!"
Laid off twice in 2 months?,"TLDR: Laid off at the new year with a couple months notice. Was able to get new position within company in a different department only for job to be eliminated when I was expecting to start. Will be laid off with last day in a week.

—

The new year started and I was notified I was getting laid off with my last day to be determined in a couple of months. Immediately looked for a new job, and luckily was offered a role by another team in a different department three weeks ago. My manager was informed and congratulated me. My last day at my current role was last week on Friday.  I was to receive instructions from the new team on next steps to start Monday the following week. Followed up with the team was told they will let me know on Monday next week and to enjoy the weekend. Monday comes and no communication. I again followed up for a status update only to be sent a 1 on 1 meeting invitation for the following day. At the meeting I was notified the position had been eliminated and my last day will be next week.

I was not surprised. When I received the offer from the other team, the following day news broke that at least 9 other projects were not doing well and will be shelved. Implying that more layoffs are coming. I figured it is likely to
Impact other groups within the company.

Its rough out there.

The group, one of the world’s biggest producers of car seats and dashboards, said it was “immediately and drastically reducing recruitment in Europe” as part of efforts to boost margins in the region, where it has struggled with overcapacity. 

The job cuts would be spread over five years, Forvia said, and would be mainly carried out by replacing departing staff and cutting back on temporary employees. It usually has an attrition rate of about 2,000 people a year, while staff stood at 75,000 at the end of last year.

Why the shock and awe? What is the point of humiliating laid off workers?,"A number of years back ago my former company eliminated some jobs. It was upsetting but everyone was calm. people worked or could leave if they had a new job. We had a gtg for drinks  the last day. It was sad but orderly. One of those people was hired back and he is a very valued employee and top performer.

They treated my layoff like a surprise battle attack or a drug bust. There were ruses to get people to locations, we were cut off email within seconds, people who were on the way to the office were not allowed in, there was security to keep us out, it took almost a month to get my desk stuff, things were broken, there was shattered glass in my boxes. I'm still waiting for the mailer for my phone. 

I just don't understand why we were treated like white collar criminals. We were not fired, we didn't steal things or do corporate espionage. I have made peace with the fact I was laid off. It will take me a long time to get over the trauma of literally being banished. "
Nationwide Hiring Freeze,"So the government agency I work for has announced a nationwide hiring freeze. Is this something you are seeing at other agencies? And if so, I would imagine the BLS jobs reports from here on out will start coming out lower than expected."
Real unemployment figures or percentage?,"Every where I meet people, they are asking? 

1. Are we really in recession?
2. For how long this will continue?
3. Those who are in job are scared and hope they continue with their jobs.
4. Those who lost jobs in last 3-15 months are willing to get into any job the moment they are beyond their 26 weeks of unemployment.

Just to make matters worse, [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) has a lot of [terms](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm) to confuse people.

There are different measures of unemployment

* U-3 (the official unemployment rate) 
* [U-6](https://www.bls.gov/lau/stalt.htm) (a broader measure that includes discouraged workers and part-time workers who would prefer full-time employment). 

U-3 is around 3.9 while U-6 is 7.3

Each measure provides a different perspective on the labor market, so it's worth considering multiple metrics when evaluating the unemployment situation. 

Is the current government concealing the unemployment rate(due to election year)? 

Or is the unemployment only common to tech sector?

Or the BLS is capturing a lot of seasonal workers to somehow prove that unemployment numbers are not that bad?

Moreover red states like Texas which are anti federal government, their figures are also not much different? According to the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC), the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Texas was 3.9% in March 2024, down from 4.1% in January 2023. This is lower than the long-term average of 5.92%.

Seriously what is going on? Moreover rematch between Biden and Trump, there are high chances, both will try to make personal attacks on each other and unemployment issues might take a back seat.

Wrongful termination,"I was terminated last year and opened an EEOC complaint.  I hired an attorney and we ended up settling out of court.  I worked for an amazing company, just had a really bad manager who blocked me from transitioning to another role.  Large company, more than 20k employees.  I would love to go back working in a different department.  My question, hopefully someone in HR or Legal can jump in here, do companies blacklist you internally once you open a complaint with some special asterisk stating that they’ll never hire you again?  If so, how long does that last, 1 year, 10 years, forever?  I still have a great network within the company and some would love to have me back.  Wondering if it’s worth it to apply again?"

"Laid off Tuesday, Surprise Job Offer Wednesday","Hi. I was laid off last Tuesday from a large tech company I had been with for exactly a year. I work in SaaS. I was doing well, hit 99% of quota in Q3 and 103% in Q4 (our FY is Feb to Feb). Had great pipeline for Q1 and FINALLY felt like I was hitting my stride, then boom, laid off. 

I was naturally pretty bummed, and the next day when an old boss called (he’d heard about the layoffs) to offer me a job I was, naturally, very excited. 

I was working as an Enterprise Account Executive selling to existing customers in the Fortune 500 at a brand name org. The new job is for a Mid-Market role at a 350 person start up in a completely different industry. 


I have 8 years closing experience, only the last two years have been enterprise. I want to stay in the Enterprise Market and work with existing business, but this new job is in mid-market and is new business. Even though its not what I want, is it stupid not to take it? I was making $210k OTE and the new role is $250k OTE. The only other consideration is my husband and I want to have a baby this year and the start up only offers 4 months mat leave.  

With all the layoffs, even with my network and connections I’m worried I won’t be able to find something quickly. Financially we can live off my husband’s salary for a while, but we want to buy a house and start a family this year. Our five year plan/budget is based around both of us working and I have no interest in being a SAHM. 

Just looking for insight to what you would do given the instability of tech sales jobs today. Should I take the job and just be miserable for a while? I don’t like new business because it doesn’t come as naturally to me as existing business. I hate cold prospecting. I can do it, and I can overachieve, but I will not be happy (most likely)."
How to Survive Another Recession (Or economic downturn if that’s what we’re calling it)!,"I wrote this the other day as a supplement to my first post in here on what to do if you're laid off! Feel free to add more suggestions.

Most of this list can apply to those who are still employed as well as those laid off. I would say, if you’re still employed, be grateful for your income but don’t let your guard down. Prepare for the worst, hope for the best!

**Financially:**

1. Beef up your emergency fund - stock up on cash. Up to a year in basic mandatory living expenses saved is great, just in case.
2. Start a side hustle - diversifying income streams is a powerful way to combat a recession. Even if it's an extra $50-$100 a month to start, it can make a difference.
3. Focus on paying down high interest debt and not accruing more (credit cards especially)
4. Invest if you can - markets are down, buy low sell high - this is where wealth is made! Don't be scared of the bear market.
5. Do not panic with your investments - easier said than done, but super important (often times no action is the best action)
6. Make sure you understand your own risk tolerance and current asset allocation (while making changes may or may not be the right move, you still should be able to sleep at night).
7. See if you can reduce monthly fixed expenses (housing, transportation costs especially - more effective than cutting out lattes and other small items)
8. Do a 30 day subscription challenge - cut out as many as possible for 30 days, after 30 days evaluate what you really miss and what you don’t
9. Track your spending using an app (easier than budgeting and gives you real time data)
10. Review your credit report and credit score - focus on improving it if needed

**Career:**

1. Learn a new skill and/or improve the ones you have, coursera and Harvard have some great free online classes
2. Clear the dust off your resume, just in case - make sure yours is designed well and highlights your accomplishments
3. Connect with your network and continue to build it - just because you haven't talked to someone in 10 years doesn't mean you can't reconnect!! Get out and make some new friends as well.
4. Update your LinkedIn - like a resume, it needs to be fresh and highlight the great things you've done. Make sure you have a good profile photo. All the relevant fields are filled out. I heard one CEO say if you don't have a professional linkedin photo and limited info in the initial screening for jobs, they'll move right on to the next candidate.
5. Look for new opportunities (again, just in case). Get a feel for what's out there in your industry and others.

**Personally:**

1. Remember recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle. Recessions are expected. We always recover.
2. Prioritize your mental and physical health. Don't let the additional stress consume you. Nip it in the bud early.
3. Spend more time with loved ones. I'm going for a walk with a friend this afternoon and I can already feel the positive affect it's having on me!!
4. Focus on healthy things that calm your nerves. The early morning quiet, a late afternoon walk, closing my eyes for 10 minutes. These all work for me, do what works for you...consistently.
5. Don’t get sucked into the noisy news cycles and fear mongering. The media generally wants you to panic and become addicted to their alarming headlines. This will not help your finances or your mental health. Tune it out as best you can.
6. Remember the average recession lasts between 10-17 months. Recessions are temporary, good habits last a lifetime."
Frustrated,"I’ve lost my job as a restaurant manager in October of last year. The notice of the layoff was given to me three days prior to the store closing, which in my opinion was so irresponsible from upper management. I never realized how terrible the job market was until I took time off after the layoff to focus on my self. From November up until now, I still have no luck in getting a job. I’ve gotten two emails about setting up interviews…I’ve reached out and no response. Two interviews…nothing back. I have an interview next week, so that’s exciting. I’m 26F and still live at home. It’s getting stressful because money is running low and bills still have to get paid. I have thought of other way to bring income like serving or UberEats.

Why say you’re hiring, if you are really not. And why reach out to me if you are not going to respond. I guess recruiters are having a lot on their plate. 

 "
Got let go fairly?,"I was let go a week ago. Verbally, I was told it was due to performance. Though they still offer a severance for me to sign.

The low performance reason does not stand in my opinion. Other than a few longer emails laying out expectations, my manager never initiated a PIP process to formally let me know performance is not good. Nor had I received colleagues' complaints. In fact, I can find emails from other colleagues thanking me for my work or fast turnaround.

I feel employer had also obstructed in my ability to work as well. I.e., employer had not approved my request to replace one of the broken computer I use at work. I feel that's a clandestine way to hinder my work. In fact, I brought my own computer to work which employer has yet to return.

A few weeks before being let go, the employer hired someone younger and less experienced to do the exact same job as me. 

And in case it matters, I have also been sick for months visiting doctors. But I never took sick days.

&#x200B;

So my question is, is this situation that I should seek some legal help? Or just sign the severance package?

Anyone here on work visa and laid off? Need some advice.,"My TL is creating a lot of problems for me and she has warned me that I might be put on PIP. In my company that’s a one way ticket to the curb. I’m on work visa and have been with this company for almost 5 years. Never had this problem with my previous managers/TLs.

I have recently purchased a house. Me and wife are paying monthly mortgage. Given the situation, if I’m let go what are my options for the mortgage payments? I have savings to last me 6 months with paying mortgages but I don’t want to spend all savings. I want to have the cash in hand if I don’t get a job for let’s say another year or so."
I'm venting-- my dream about my layoff,"So I was really laid off in October-- everything was handled really poorly IMO, and I think that ,plus a NIGHTMARE involving past identity theft with unemployment insurance are why I have felt traumatized.

Last night I had a dream about my old job from 2012 to 2017. I was NOT laid off there, I left it for the new job. But that was the dream I had last night that I was being laid off from the OLD job.

In the dream a security guard tried to get me to let someone else pack my stuff but I got to do it myself, in my dream my boss was initially unemotional but when I was walking out the door she was very sad and said she was very sorry she had to lay me off. (Ironically she is a very emotionally reserved person.)

And I realize THAT WAS ALL I WANTED. All I wanted was my actual boss to treat me like a human, to say they appreciated my work for half a dozen years, and they appreciated me being an essential worker during the pandemic when I had to go into large crowds, and say they were sorry this happened. I truly could have accepted the rest of it.

Would that have been so hard? I really think 10 seconds of empathy from my boss would have changed my experience and how I coped with the situation."
Finally employed ,"Was terminated 8 weeks into employment in for a shitty company running there dispensary in Florida as the GM, terrible fit and the pot heads were running the place. Took me 6 weeks, did about 7 interviews and about about 250 applications  but I got an another job as an assistant manager ( from salary to hourly with an actual opportunity at commission and bonus ). It's a paycut hourly but gotta feed the fam and pay the rent. "
Rumor of layoff,"The company I work at has closed some locations nationwide and there are rumors of layoffs in the future. For now they are just rumors but they are slightly credible. There were some articles in the WSJ and other publications. If the layoffs happen they will happen as soon as May, 2025 or 2027. Which steps should I take to prepare? Should I wait till the rumors become true or plan a transition soon?"
Extra distrustful of my new employer and boss ,"I got laid off back in October. Loved the job and the products we worked on, despite often wondering why my workload was always so light.

I got another job offer after about 45 days and I started back in December. I'm grateful to have found something in my industry this quickly, but the pay isn't what I'm used to and my new role is a lot more demanding.

I'm finding it so difficult to trust my new manager. I'm so resistant to letting him get to know me, I'm so resistant to admitting anything I'm struggling with, and my guard is just so up. Everything he says sounds passive aggressive to me, even though he's really just eager and not super self aware and I'm probably projecting a lot

I loved my last manager. Looked up to her. Learned a lot from her. Trusted and respected her a lot. Confided a lot in her. 
And none of that prevented the company from discarding me.

I am so jaded and distrustful of my new employer I'm convinced the microphone on my laptop is listening to me even when I'm not in meetings. I'm paranoid to take a therapy appointment or say something disparaging in the same room as my work computer.

I know it's a good lesson to learn that you should never trust an employer *too* much, but the active distrust that I cannot seem to let go of is really impacting me emotionally at work and it just makes working even more miserable than it has to be

Has anyone else experienced these types of lingering emotions about being laid off even after moving onto a new position?"
QUESTION! Unemployment,"My role was eliminated in a mass layoff by Amazon.

We are paid for the next 60 days (as required by law “WARN” Act) and then my termination date it will be then.

They said they no longer need us laid off people to work so basically we get two months of paid vacation, lol and they shut down our accounts, can no longer access email. They did that like 5 mins after we got told our job was being eliminated.

Anyway, when should I begin filing for unemployment? After 60 days?

Although I am working hard to apply to jobs, it’s tough. I feel like it could take me six months to find a decent position.

I just want to be prepared.."

"""We're all one team."" - A brief merger and layoff story.","About 5 years ago I was working for a company that was purchased by another company, the details will be left out for obvious reasons. They called it a merger. What's the difference between a merger and an acquisition anyway? People with my company thought it was a merger because that was the language that was used internally but I once heard someone from the other company say something to the effect of ""we bought you.""

In any case, the company I was with had some corporate BS like ""5 key principles"" or whatever. The other company had a similar set of corporate BS like ""8 core values"". After the merger/acquisition, leadership decided to merge the two sets of principles or values into a single document of key-core values-principles, because after a merger it's very important that all your corporate BS be aligned.

One of the items on this list post merger was ""We are all one team."" Sounds nice. Solidarity! Unity! Teamwork! Then we had some ""consultants"" show up one day. (What is it consultants are paid to do anyway? Oh well it's probably nothing.) I'll skip past the middle because you know where this is going. Soon we found out that our customer service would be merged with the CS department of the other company.

Here's the part that will always stick with me. *The day after* our CS department had been laid off, a company-wide email was sent out by the CEO saying ""**we are now one step closer to being one team**.""

After this experience I'll never be able to look at corporate life the same way again. Maybe I was just naive or stupid, but now whenever I hear corporate people talking about key values or core principles or ""we're a family"" or any other similar flavor of bullshit, I just can't take it. It's all so fake and I'm done pretending that it's not."
Vroom Announces Wind-Down of Ecommerce Used Vehicle Operations,
Another holiday season layoff,"Just discovered this sub so decided to post about it now. But I got my notice the week before Thanksgiving. Not even gonna make it to 1 year at this company as I started in January. My last day is the 29th. First time was back in 2018, the Monday after Thanksgiving. I had a feeling about that one as I was a consultant riding the bench for about 2 months straight, so I had started job searching and landed 2 offers just 3 weeks after the layoff. This one was totally unexpected, as I was working on a project team for one of the flagship applications. Fortunately I have 2 interviews coming up first 2 weeks of January so hoping one of those work out.

The lesson learned from this is, never take any job for granted because your role can be eliminated without any second thought from leadership, regardless of how important you think the work you’re doing is."
"If a firm is struggling , why would they hire more people ?","My old firm from 2 years ago let a lot of people go. It’s a small 100 person tech firm. 

I found out they recently hired 7-10 new people in the past 2 months. 

There are still a lot of underperforming employees in the firm. They lost several gigantic accounts that make up the majority of the revenue for the firm. 

My manager said “ oh everyone is fine. Don’t worry “ but I don’t believe it. 

Also, there was a new CEO and VP last year. All the new 10 hires came from the CEO old firm ? 

We are struggling in sales but they hired new people ? What is going on here ? Is this a hostile takeover ?If anyone has any comments please let me know.

Finding financial stability amid layoffs ,"After being laid off, you can only search for a job for so long before needing another source of income. Once the severance package and savings have dwindled, you find yourself applying for positions out of desperation. I understand the common sentiment that it's easier to find a job while already employed, and that any paycheck is better than none. However, in an emergency situation, where can you find a job that covers your bills? This would be to help you stay afloat until you secure your desired job.

"Force quit, layoffs and PTO time in Florida","My company went from 5 days a week to work from home during covid, now forcing 2 days a week at the office with possible 3 days now. I think they are trying to force people to quit and well i just got another job and want to quit. I know that courtesy calls for 2 weeks notice, the problem is i have about 40h of pto that they “probably” (i truly dont know) wont pay me (im in Florida no laws around it) 

So here are a few options:

a) give my 2 weeks and risk losing my PTO (i would pick this in a heartbeat cuz i rather get the extra money, but not sure how to guarantee it)

b) take my 40 hours of PTO then give them 1 week notice

c) open to suggestions"

Customer Success Layoffs,"Hi all, I’m curious to see if this type of position has been impacted at all.

Is anyone a Customer/Client Success Manager (or in an adjacent position) in tech and has experienced a recent layoff? If so, did you see it coming or was it completely out of the blue?"
Economic downturn,"Is it just me, or is this latest economic downturn an example of a self-fulfilling prophecy?

Employees started making slightly more, causing a panic amongst the golden parachute crowd. C-suite execs got the notion that people getting paid in line with their value was going to cause a downturn and - starting with tech - began massive layoffs before there was any real proof of economic trouble. Now, of course, these mass layoffs have ensured a recession.

If I were more cynical, I’d say this was a move to claw back the incremental gains that regular working people made in the Covid economy."
Is it common to leave “-present” on your LinkedIn?,"I haven’t been laid off but I’m preparing for the possibility. I notice several people don’t update their LinkedIn after they have been laid off. They leave “whatever year - present” as the dates they worked for the company, often for months before they get a new job. Is this common practice?

It seems dishonest but at the same time you have to do what you have to do. It’s not fair to be denied employment because you have a “laid off stink” on you.

On the other hand, if a prospective employer finds out you were actually laid off 8 months ago, it might be a red flag. Seems risky.

I was just wondering what is considered acceptable.

—————
Update:

Great discussion folks. Where I kind of come down is the penalty for being unemployed is so disproportionately high that it makes sense not to give the most up to date information on LinkedIn, but instead give that information in the resume after a recruiter has shown interest and explain the situation if needed.

It feels a little dishonest, but let’s imagine an analogous scenario. Imagine picking your boogers is socially taboo. Should you always update your profile with the last time you picked your boogers? It would be nice to be honest, but the cost of honesty is so out of line with the punishment for picking your boogers, and picking your boogers doesn’t hurt anyone, so why allow yourself to be discriminated in that way?

That’s where I am right now. I’ll think on it more."
Cautiously optimistic news!,
Side income to supplement unemployment benefits ,"A lot of people might be under the impression that if you earn any income, your unemployment benefits will either get reduced or stopped completely. That’s not true at all in my state (IL)! We’re allowed to earn, as long as the weekly earnings are under the benefit amount, so for me I’m capped under $500 per week. UB for a lot of us aren’t close to enough to cover expenses ($7k monthly income down to $2700). So definitely check with your state if you’re in a position to do a side gig while job searching!"
And so it goes...,"I joined this sub when I felt something was off at work. My department was hemorrhaging employees under a toxic boss who couldn't manage their way out of a paper bag. Many complaints had been made but nothing was done about it. And any request for new people were not being granted despite being short. The only help we got was temps. And the way they were hyping up that new location, I knew something was going on. 

My stomach dropped the moment yesterday I saw there was an 8:30am meeting that was scheduled for this morning. When I looked at the people included, I could tell it was either an airing of the grievances or it was something worse. 

And then this morning, my boss' boss read out a statement to us saying that our department was being outsourced to the new location. And for the record, my boss was informed at the same time as we were that they were gone.

I'm not done yet but I will be in April, barring any sudden job offers. Thankfully, I had been applying elsewhere and had enough foresight to see this was coming but for people like my boss, it was a shock. 

This job gave me a security. It introduced me to some really good friends. It led to me finding the love of my life. It gave me purpose when I was lacking it. It made me feel for a time that everything was alright. Upon hindsight, that was a foolish thought. 

I want to angrily blame my boss for making our jobs seem inconsequential. I want to cry over the fact that this is really a roadblock in the way of my dreams of buying a house. I want to tell the company to go to hell and burn my bridges. I want to curl up in bed and just snooze through the rest of the year. Despite all I want to do. I know I shouldn't. Not right now. It won't do any good. 

For now, I'm still there and earning a paycheck. For now, it will be business as usual with a few wrinkles included. For now, it's spending my lunch breaks beefing up my resume to make myself as valuable as I truly am. For now, it's applying to anything on Indeed near my location with the hopes of some phone call or email. For now, things are fine....

But I know that be over soon. Time moves faster than it seems and before I know it, my time will be over. Anything that may be a loose end is no longer my problem. And there's something freeing about that. Maybe I'll get the job in the other department but I'm not holding my breath. Things will be different, but that's okay. 

So until the day comes for me, I shall hold my head high and do my best until the day comes that I move on, whether with or within the company. 

But seriously, what the hell?!"

Should I go to a company actively doing layoffs? Or should I stay with current company.,"I received a job offer for another company that is actively doing layoffs. My current company just did layoffs as well (but I'm not a target and won't be upon discussion with my manager).

Now I am uncertain if I should go to new company that has higher pay and benefits with possibility of being laid off, or stay at current job and suck it up.

Edit: It is also important to note that I already filed for resignation. The timeline I have is that I filed for resignation last week (also rejected counteroffer), heard about the layoffs this weekend, waiting for onboarding and first day next week."
Do you think it’ll become a trend for those affected by layoffs to move to India to deal with the outsourcing?,"A lot of talent, especially entry level talent, is being outsourced to India. And layoffs there are less since it’s cheaper. At my company, when we had layoffs, none of the Indian staff were affected. 

Do you think it might be a viable strategy for many of these laid off staff to move to India so they’ll at least have a job?"

Some tips on how to get a job,"As someone was laid off and applied to over 500 jobs to finally landing a job, I've learned quite a bit over the last 8 months.

I hope my experience in this job market can help you improve your chances.

&#x200B;

1. Be descriptive on your resume and LinkedIn profile. Be descriptive on job functions and list your skills. Some companies use text scanning software to identify certain keywords. If certain keywords don't exist, they will likely ignore you. If you have only 3 sentences describing your previous job functions, why bother applying?
2. Apply to jobs in the same industry or specialization as your previous job. Don't bother casting a wide net. Companies are getting the best of the best candidates and many of these candidates have big name companies on their ledger. 3-5% of these applicants will have near perfect qualifications. Make a list of companies in your industry or specialization and check their websites to see if there are job openings. If you're focused on the right industry, you could be in that 3-5%.
3. Don't overvalue yourself. Be open to taking a pay cut because the market has changed and it's super competitive. Get into the expectation that your next job may pay up to 25% less. It's better to land a job that pays less than not have a job at all.
4. Always be super prepared for every interview. Research the company and the product and learn as much as you can. They will be impressed that you took the time to learn about what they do. If they have an app, download it and sign up and use it if it's free. If they have a website, do the same.
5. Be prepared to talk about yourself and the relevant experiences. Put everything down on a presentation and organize everything. Have 1 slide about yourself, 1 slide about your experiences and 1 slide about the relevant experience for the job you're interviewing for, and slides with sample projects. You may not need it, but you can rely on it when you need to.
6. Avoid big panel interviews. When the recruiter tells you that they're going to do a panel interview, ask them how many people will be there. If they say 4 or more, make a request to break them up into groups of 2, so it can be more manageable. You'll be less nervous and there's a lower chance of making a bad impression with your answers.

Hope that helps.

HR Director Schedules all hands for meeting End of Day Tuesday.,"Update: No layoffs. Calling everyone back to office as remote work is now banned. We have 3 months to make the transition or resign. 


Why would HR wait until 5pm Froday to Schedule and all hands ""business strategy"" meeting on Tuesday End of Day?!?!. There is no agenda outlined like usual. 

We just had a company wide reorg and last year there were two rounds off layoffs in September and in February. 

I am freaking out thinking it's layoffs again!  What should I do to prepare if we are being laid off?"

Turning Out to be Blessing,"So the layoff I just went through- turns out it was a blessing in disguise. My co-workers are telling me that the company is awful right now. They are currently merging two companies together and basically everyone feels like they are getting pushed out. The company morale has plummeted. My old co-workers are searching for jobs.

I was able to get two months normal base pay for the next two months plus severance package. 

And I ended up having an internal ecruiter reach out to me, telling me about an opportunity they are creating (that hasn’t been posted on job site yet) and they would like me to be one of the first people they meet with. 

My interviews went well. The team was awesome, laid back, easy to talk to and intelligent. They have passion for the business and they were transparent with their current struggles.

I met with hiring manager (last week) and the executive director (yesterday) to which he told me that the hiring manager had nothing but amazing feedback about me. 
He continued to talk as if I had already secured the job saying things like “When you meet the team, you’ll really like Billybob as he is blah blah blah” and so on. He mentioned multiple times how my experience was invaluable. 

At the end of the meeting, I asked what was next in the hiring process. He said “We want to get this hiring process done fast, well… as fast as HR will go.” 

I have not received an official verbal offer… But they have been very quick with this whole process. I am so excited. Things are starting to look up. It’s been three weeks since my layoff."
Laid off due to job elimination - now rehiring?,"After 5 years of building a brand to reposition against its competition and drive millions in revenue, my boss decides to retire and sell the business.

New leader has never had marketing, was giving bad information about performance from sales (who was not entering data correctly) leader didn’t want to hear anything, labeled me an under performer and six months of hell later laid me off.

During those six months leads and revenue plummeted because she had me stop doing what I was doing to focus on bogus activities.  She questioned everyone as to why it’s been so slow?  Then lied to the employees that the market is slow.  Seven months after laying me off, there are NO new clients, only repeat orders, and low value ones at that.  It’s been over a year and they have been in the red.

The sales leader who was promoted has now jumped ship and they moved another sales person over in a lower role to cover them.

I noticed they are now hiring someone to do everything I did.  However, it’s now reporting to the sales team instead of upper management.  The same sales team who failed and the reason I was brought in, in the first place.  The sales team who hasn’t sold in a year?  

And to add insult to injury - the salary is $25k less and I was already underpaid.  It’s also an entry level role!  So they want someone to do a director level role for entry level pay?

Why would you do this?  Because they saw me as an under-performer and ignorantly think they can get someone to do what I did (with 15 years of experience?). Or because they are desperate and trying to save a sinking ship?"
Has anyone been laid off with a conditional extension and conditional severance? What’s the point?,"I was recently laid off, and “out of great appreciation” I get to work there until June 30th. I don’t get my severance unless I stay til then and I also have an incentive bonus of $5,000 to stay til til. Has anyone been in the same boat? I’m not sure I understand the logic. I want to negotiate my severance to leave immediately because I was poached by competitor a day later but legit trapped by the weird conditional stay. "
Okta to Cut 400 Jobs in Latest Round of Layoffs,

Promoted during large layoff. Has anyone else experienced this?,"Hi, not posting to gloat. Company is a private equity portfolio company with executive takeover from previous leadership in the spring. Has been a stressful, anxiety-ridden experience.

Company announced its third layoff in 1-year. Engineering side of the business was heavily impacted, ~15% let go. My division went through a restructuring with several on my team let go, less than 5% impacted. Same day as layoffs, My director informed me that I’d be getting promoted with a title increase and pay raise, effective next pay period.

Has anyone ever experienced this? Obviously I feel survivorship guilt from a coworkers being let go but I feel like I’m being “bought” by work. Feels so odd to be promoted during a layoff. I don’t have a ton of work experience so what's the rationale for promotion here?

Im worried about being judged from HR/Director with a new title (like a 90 day probation period) where I’ll get pipped and then silently let go from the company. Basically set up to fail type situation. It just feels political in a way?"

Struggling After Layoff: Seeking Advice on Rebuilding Confidence,"I'm reaching out here because I'm feeling lost and unsure about how to move forward after a recent layoff from a startup where I was working as an FP&A Analyst. Let me give you a bit of background.

I have over 5 years of experience in fund administration, primarily focused on financial reporting. With a Bachelor's in accounting and auditing plus a CPA under my belt, I've always received positive feedback in my corporate roles. After a brief stint in a PE admin company following my master's in finance, I decided to take on a new challenge and join a young startup.

Despite lacking direct experience in forecasting, the co-founders saw potential in my managerial skills and brought me on board. However, things quickly took a turn for the worse. There was no formal training provided, and any mistakes I made were met with harsh criticism instead of constructive feedback. It felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells, and my confidence took a major hit.

Last week, I was laid off, leaving me feeling like a failure. I'm struggling with self-doubt and anxiety, and the thought of applying for new jobs terrifies me. How do I explain this situation in interviews? How do I regain my confidence?

I'd appreciate any advice or words of wisdom from those who have been through similar experiences. How did you cope with setbacks like this, and what steps did you take to rebuild your confidence and move forward?

Thank you in advance for your support."

Recruiter’s Professionalism,"So a little venting for you..I had a call lined up with a recruiter today who quickly told me over the phone that the salary I was requesting per the posting was too high. Why call me and waste my time then? She also said if I lowered my expectation to the job posting amount that she wouldn’t believe me. Ummm excuse me? She said she hasn’t made any offer over $100k to her engineers in the last 3 years. I told her the last 3 years has had 5-8% inflation but she didn’t seem to care about that. I kept it professional and said well if you come up at all maybe we’ll reconnect. She did smooth things over a little after disagreeing on salary and we talked about the weather briefly before finishing the call. I think she was curious why I might expect so much as she hadn’t seen that in the market. Am I off base on a Midwest salary for a general maintenance engineer role in manufacturing? I’m also considering reliability or project engineering where the salary might be higher.

For a little background I’m in manufacturing as a maintenance engineer with 5 years experience and $105k base and was requesting around $115k in the Midwest. This is flexible depending on the job hours/responsibilities which can vary largely from company to company. 

Just a reminder to be professional. I had to vent as the job search has not been as pleasant from my side of the process as I would expect from recruiters."
On the other side of it,"I work at a national org and we're planning on letting go of more than 80 people. It is the biggest mass layoff I've ever been involved in and it's because we've lost a huge funding stream recently. It is literally no one's fault. But still, here I am, having to advise on how to best support people on both sides of the crappy conversation. My advice during layoff is to carefully review your package - if you're older, you should be entitled to more than someone who's in their 20s. Ask for your benefits to be extended, ask for career planning services. 

If you're reading this and you're doing the layoff - have some empathy, don't make the conversation about you and for the love of God don't say ""I know how you feel"" - no, you don't. 

 I honestly wish I could take someone place. I hate this."

Crazy Getting Laid Off Story ,"I’m going to be vague as to details of the company etc but the story is the story. 

I was hired out of law school at a very large company with a lot of promises made to me. 

Did not go as planned as change up in team before I came aboard (was in last semester of school)

9 months after I start (and I hated it) they lay me off but pay me 3 months severance which is a lot for having only been there for 3 months. 

I start another job and I look and they just paid me a bonus. I get a text from my old VP that says hey we’re still big fans this is prorated for 2023 hope it was a nice surprise. 

No mention in severance agreement of being eligible for my bonus. 

Has this happened to anyone else?

How have you handled burnout?,"Hi all,  looking for some advice for anyone who has experienced some of the same.  

I love my job, and I’m good at it.  I’ve been here over 10 years and survived at least 10 layoffs (that I am aware of).  We are in an industry that is somewhat cyclical, and have been heavily impacted by the pandemic and electronic component shortages.

This past year, I’ve had significant brain fog that has severely impacted my performance and I am on the path to being let go.  I have trouble remembering things, confuse topics, or remember things incorrectly.  Because my mind isn’t alright, I’m defensive, which is just compounding the issue.  I’ve also had some health issues the past year, and possibly long covid.

I want to be able to save my job, but feel that the only way I can possibly do that is by taking a break from work to be able to get healthy.  Has anyone ever taken FMLA or another path due to ‘burnout’ at work?  How did you go about initiating it?"
"With all the layoffs, when do we anticipate the market to improve a bit.","Long story short, Promotion has been stuck from last 2 yrs, barely any raise but working without much complains due to the economy and circumstances. Inflation has made deep holes in savings, pockets."
Has anyone else noticed layoffs are handled differently these days?,"I spent a good amount of time at my last employer. It was always terrifying when restructuring and whatnot would come about every year or two. However, when it would happen, we would normally have a hiring freeze for a few months, severance was an option, and then people would have \~90 days to decide on severance or find a new position. While not always the most ideal scenario, I'd watch most people land on their feet. Many would find a new role within the company. The hiring freeze kept some positions open for those impacted. Some people chose the severance and did something else. That same company today calls you into the office, reads a script, and you are immediately terminated (with severance). 

Honestly, I'm not one to shake my fist at every restructuring and scream, ""Corporate greed!"" Sometimes, it honestly makes sense. Sometimes, it doesn't. However, it's extremely unfortunate to watch a process go from taking steps to minimize impact to complete disregard. Has anyone noticed this?"
How Does HR Look at Laid Off Candidates?,"Hi, first time…just got laid off yesterday for the first time in my career.

Do they try to take advantage and low ball offer you if they like you?"
Feeling miserable and hopeless,"I am 35 male and from India. Have 10+ years of experience in my field. i got laid of again. 2nd layoff in 2 years (previous job lasted for 8 months and current job lasted for 10 months) and i feel miserable and low on confidence. My 2nd layoff occurred just 1 week after my engagement and i am the sole bread winner for my family. Got 3 month severance so i am frantically applying so that can get some money running again. Have already applied to 40 jobs, some matching my field and some not related to my field in my location. Many recruiters see my 2 current short stints and wonder if I can be a reliable employee now. I can understand layoffs happen  but to happen twice in short time frame has shattered my confidence and self-esteem and it's not even my fault. Sometimes I wonder why do all the hardwork if nothing is in my hand. Thanks for listening and best of luck to who are in same boat."
Dish Network Lays Off Engineers with no severance,"On August 1st management was dragging employees  out of the DTC office and telling them that they were being let go due to “reorganization”. Nobody (at my level) has any clue how many were let go, but 80 has been thrown around. they laid people off in the least efficient way possible and made the entire day horrific. throughout the day, your manager may show up at your desk and tell you to pack up. The least courtesy they could have done is just to do it all at once, so that employees weren’t waiting anxiously with a box at their desk.


The layoffs also seemed random with no rhyme or reason. people on large important projects got canned, but so did people on small projects.  A mix of poor and good performers as well. 


No severance was offered, even to those with the company for 20+ years. Management has not acknowledged the layoff to the rest of the employees. No all team meeting, no memo, nothing. Dish seems to be in some dire financial straits. just look at the stock. If you are still at Dish, you best be sorting out your fastest way out of there."
tech layoffs and h1 b program,"I was laid off in January 2023 after working my ass off for that company for 2 decades.

I see so many skilled engineers looking for a job. 

US labor is getting royally screwed here with more cheap labor being imported when the market is already messed because of over supply of labor . 

If tech labor does not lobby to stop the h1 b program we are done and will have no leverage whatsoever.

Out of work? Can't find a new job? There is hope.,"I got layed off a little over a year ago from the job I planned on retiring at. I was the most experienced in my position and am sure they did it solely for monetary reasons as the other 25 people they let go were all the more experienced in theirs as well. During my tenure there I worked a lot of overtime to cover for the lack of hiring enough help in my position and was told during that year that I needed to ""slow down"" or I would get burned out. I cut hours back a little (2800hrs/yr down to about 2500hrs/yr avg. Which was the goal in my yearly review as requested by management) as soon as work started piling up they decided that I had a ""bad attitude"" along with most of the others that were let go and a ""culture shift"" was needed. A year later someone still working there sent me a photo of the ""year in review"" meeting they had with a graph showing ""massive"" profits from the month that all of us were let go. (They also lost another 25 people to attrition during the transition) the company is hanging on by a thread from what I've heard.

I spent 6 months looking for work in my field and outside my field and heard nothing in the over 250+ applications I sent out. (7.5+ years exp CNC machining with a focus on 3D programming, 10+ years in production work) I would have had to take a $30k/yr drop in wages to get something close to ""what I was good at/trained for.""

Within a few weeks I was out of my mind! I was on the VERY edge. Depression and not knowing what to do. Unfulfilled completely by housework and chauffeuring the kids to and from school. So I took a simple ""money doesn't matter"" job to try and help again with cash flow. Being behind a computer for so long and a few accidents in the past made me realize I couldn't do the grunt work anymore (my back is destroyed) and I had to quit.

Luckily right about the same time my wife got a big raise for taking over payroll. And we had already been planning and budgeting for her being at home full time for the kids in the near future (before I got laid off). Never in a million years would I have expected that to be me. I was in the military, and doing production for long years I have that ""work horse"" in me you could say. I was more worried at the time about losing my mind again than I was losing my house.

So I shifted my focus.

 I know this doesn't work monetarily for most people on here. I know not everyone is as lucky as I was. I still have to wrap my mind around ""doing nothing with my hands"" every day.

But the biggest thing that helped was getting a job (any job) and then finding out what I really wanted to do. I'm now a happier stay at home dad. My job is my family, and getting to spend time with my kids is amazing. And now instead of worrying about why it happened to me and what is still going on at that old place, I have put it all behind me and found something I truly love again.

 I am finishing up a book that I told myself I would never have the time to write. It should be in publishing in a few weeks. Hopefully i'll get some sort of compensation for my time and thoughts while I build the rest of the brand to go with the book. 2 more books are in the works. I am drawing up a graphic novel that tells the same story to come out in 6 months (for those of you who don't like reading as much). 3D modeling exp shifted to action figures and ""dumb"" ideas that go with the brand. Anything that can ""make a buck"".

Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought I could take my passion for art (always wanted to tattoo growing up) and actually make something with it.

I guess the moral of my story is...Grab on to something! Life, love, a ""stupid"" job. Pay the bills. SOMETHING! Do not give up ever! Maybe just shift your focus...like I did. Shift your thinking...there is something out there for you...and Money isn't everything. Rebudget...a lot. Sell your ""junk"". Reset what you think you need. Make life work for you."
CNBC: Weekly jobless claims post lowest reading since September 2022,"The labor market continued to show surprising resiliency in the early days of 2024, with initial jobless claims posting an unexpected drop last week.

Initial filings for unemployment insurance totaled 187,000 for the week ended Jan. 13, the lowest level since Sept. 24, 2022, the [Labor Department reported](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf)Thursday. The total marked a 16,000 decline from the previous week and came in below the Dow Jones estimate of 208,000.

Labor strength has persisted despite attempts by the Federal Reserve to slow the economy, and the jobs market in particular, through a series of interest rate hikes. Central bank policymakers have linked the supply-demand mismatch between companies and the available labor pool as an ingredient that had sent inflation to its highest level in more than 40 years.

Along with the drop in weekly claims came an unexpected decline of 26,000 in continuing claims, which run a week behind. The total for continuing claims hit 1.806 million, below the FactSet estimate for 1.83 million.

“Employers may be adding fewer workers monthly, but they are holding onto the ones they have and paying higher wages given the competitive labor market,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.

In other economic news Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed reported that its [manufacturing index](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/mbos-2024-01) registered a reading of -10.6 for January, representing the difference between companies reporting growth against contraction. While the number marked an increase from the -12.8 posted in December, it was still below the Dow Jones estimate of -7.

The Philadelphia Fed gauge showed a decline in unfilled orders, delivery times and inventories. The employment index improved somewhat but was still negative at -1.8 while the prices paid and received measures both eased from December.

A third report Thursday showed some optimism for housing: Building permits totaled 1.495 million, a monthly increase of 1.9% and a bit above the 1.48 million estimate, [according to the Commerce Department](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/current/index.html). However, housing starts totaled 1.46 million, a 4.3% monthly decline but better than the 1.43 million estimate.

The reports come a day after the Fed, in its periodic summary of economic conditions, reported mostly stagnant activity since late November.

According to the central bank’s [Beige Book report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/BeigeBook_20240117.pdf), the economy broadly showed “little or no change in economic activity” during the period.

On employment, the report did note signs of a “cooling labor market,” with lower wage pressures. On housing, it said high interest rates were limiting activity, though the prospects of future easing from the Fed were raising hopes that the pace could accelerate."
Shouldn’t we be asking our elected officials about how they plan to tackle this?,IMF warns AI to hit almost 40% of jobs worldwide
I was laid off from a toxic workplace I feel free today,Hi worked at an agency and things got really toxic 8 months ago. They put me through PIP I performed well no matter what. So they had to end my PIP there was no strong reason to let me go. So eventually they started giving me 6+ projects at once and setting unrealistic goals and timelines. Finally I was burnt out to another level and just couldn't take it that's where they let me go. I feel sorry I put myself through this shit but I am on a visa so quitting was not the best option. Now I feel relived and so much better and free. I really hope something better comes out if this! 
Layoff... very scary not the end of the world.,"I'm writing this today in hopes that some of you can find inspiration if you are impacted.

Four years ago I was let go at GM, their largest in history.  We knew it was coming down, rumors had been swirling for a couple of years, but 3 months before it actually happened, our CIO made it official in an all hands.

Before the layoff, here is the super short version of a 2-year saga with some drama including HR.  I took on a new non-technical role (encouraged by my manager with the goal to make me a manager at some point) and that proved to be a BAD idea.  This required me to do presentations, etc., not what I was used to just resolving technical issues.

I was in a bad situation I knew I was probably on the top of the list layoffs.  Let's just say my management and team was not what I was used to professionally.  They were playing games with me and wanted to get me outdoor one way or the other.  I knew they were scheming, but they have to follow the corporate rules. They were even worried I would find another internal job before they could act.  That's how nuts it was.  I dropped into high anxiety and mild depression.  I didnt think I could be making the money GM was paying, even my manager openly complained about my salary.

But I tried to make it work and my manager while a hill Billie jerk sometimes showed signs of wanting to see me succeed.  I knew it was just a manager thing, they all have to be fake sometimes.  But in that process, I had to learn how to do presentations in front of a large audience.  I eventually got pretty good at it.  Something I never thought I would do well throughout my 20 years.  I was always the technical guy behind the scenes.

Knowing I would probably get wacked one day, I did a couple of interviews with recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn.  I had a couple of job offers and interviewed at one doing cool stuff with AI technology.  But I eventually declined it because a GM manager buddy of mine convinced me to stay at GM because the severance would probably amount to 1 year and the other job paid $25K less.  He was also in hot water at GM (will come back to this later).

When my CIO made the announcement, I reached out to the manager of the AI company to let him know I could be available.  To my surprise, he mentioned that he would consider me as they had openings.  I was surprised, because I had rejected them 1 year earlier.

When the day finally came, my director, who didnt like me, walked me out the door.  It was fast and there was a strong sense of relief when it was finally over.  The whole process didnt take long.

I actually had another job offer with a large company similar size and process like GM.  This company woudl offer me 10K more than the AI company.  I pondered which one I would take, it agonized me deeply.  I said to myself, why take the job similar to GM.  Same corp IT stuff you have been doing for 15 years.  Why not take a chance on this AI startup?  Do something for your passion and not the highest bidder for once.  

So there we go, I took the job with the AI company making far less than what I was used to.

I've been here 4 years now, and all I can say is I have the most amazing manager, a great team, a great culture, great benefits, etc.  Its been cloud 9 since my arrival.  I've done so well here and have so much enthusiasm for my work, I've now a regional lead in one of the areas and make far more than what I made at GM.  Taking this job was the best decision I made in my career.  It does not feel like work, it feels like playing a video game all day like when I was a kid.

Here’s where the jobs are for February 2024 — in one chart,"Job gains are led by healthcare, hospitality, government and construction sectors. With very high fiscal spending by the government it's not surprising seeing big uptake in public sector jobs. From the article there's been decline in manufacturing and tech sectors as well.

Perspective of not layed off employees on the layoffs,"Don’t get me wrong you guys have it worse but just want to point out those of us that survive (so far) are 1) scared we will be in the next wave and 2) having to pick up more work.

2-hour homework assignment before phone screen,"I applied for a product manager role. A week or two later, I received an email asking me to complete a two-hour homework assignment.

Should I worry about my 401k on my way out of my current company?,"I’ve been employed at a live event production company for the last 20 months. It’s been struggling financially in that time due to the current economic climate+HCOL location+ripple effects from the 2023 WGA/SAG-AFTRA strikes.

After surviving a series of layoffs and budget cuts, time finally ran out on my current position. Rather than laying me off, my supervisors have kept me in the dark regarding the future of my role/department since last Fall, and started becoming more passive-aggressive towards me. After a huge disagreement that would’ve tainted my rep had I chosen to react with anger, I put in three weeks notice.

My role will be dissolved, with my job duties being dispersed amongst the already-burdened staff of 3 that remains behind. 

I’m not surprised given the deteriorating situation here, yet am grateful that they’ve honored my notice and are keeping it above board nearly three weeks later. I’ve had several interviews/phone screenings since, but no job offer as of yet.

This is the first job that’s offered me a 401k+employer match; I’m scheduled to walk away with at least $15k (including 20% of vested contributions), but am paranoid about my soon-to-be former employer trying anything funny with my account.

Does my 401k administrator protect me against employer situations such as this, or should I be keeping my head on a swivel? Thanks."
AI as a part of layoffs?,"Hey, all. 

Executives still seem to be saying that layoffs are mostly happening due to a disparity between efficiency and labor cost. Today, I read a blog by Scott Galloway stating he thinks AI is a bigger reason for all these layoffs than is being reported. 

The article is here: https://www.profgalloway.com/corporate-ozempic/

Also, there is this article by Fortune:  https://fortune.com/2024/02/08/how-many-workers-laid-off-because-of-ai/amp/

It kind of blew my mind how many people were saying it was a lot of tripe. You mean to tell me all these high-profile tech companies doing layoffs like Google, Meta, and so on aren’t laying people off and then planning on replacing some of the roles with AI? Or at the very least, overburdening the remaining staff with using AI to fill in for the staff who was discharged? 

I could be wrong, but I was in the tech field and there were so many people saying marketing, copywriting, project management roles would be replaced by AI. In fact, I believe my last job loss was related to AI, among other things. 

The dishonesty is so tiring. Even the rep at the employment department told me people should look for government jobs because the private sector is going to be fucked by AI. Opinions? Thoughts? What the heck is going on in this job market?"
What happens in the wake of a layoff (marketing/design),"When a company suffers layoffs and its marketing/design teams are impacted, who is responsible for getting design work done?

Redundancies announced,"Even with all the layoffs happening across gaming companies this last months I still thought It wasn't going to affect me.
That was until yesterday when we all had an emergency meeting and were told that ""due to a decline in demand, positions would be made redundant"".

I'm new in the industry (been working in it for less than two years) and it's the first time that I experience this and honestly I am paralysed at the moment, according to the law of the country I'm in because I haven't worked for 2 years I get no compensation at all, and our sector has no union as far as I am aware, the company has asked us to chose representatives and that they will discuss everything with them.

Should I stay and see if I'm not affected? Should I step up as representative? Should I start sending in CVs just in case? 

Honestly any insight, advice, story or absolutely anything you could bring to the table would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"
Layoff,"It’s been two months since I am searching for a job in the analytics domain. I got a few interviews in January at companies like Amazon, Samsara, SoFi, CVS. But I am not able to convert it.

It all goes well in the first few rounds and then I get rejected after the last round saying they chose another candidate. I am going mad.

Is everyone here waiting to get on the next ship that pulls them in, or are there folks here building boats themselves ? If so, have you considered putting your heads together ? There is a LOT of sharp multi faceted talent here. 

Some of you may have the resources to stay afloat for a while, and this may be a good way to stay sane.

Complex Situation - Need Advice,"Hello, I am currently in a very tough spot at work. I got demoted from a manager role and put in the most shittiest area under the team I used to previously manage. I haven’t been laid off, but I have been given a less than average rating as well. The writing is on the wall. I feel like leaving the job everyday. But I bear through the day because - employment. I have a good amount of savings and I dont need to work for the next two or three years if I dont have to. 

I am worried about not finding a job if I quit and the gap it brings in my work. The other thing I was thinking was to bear the humiliation until I find another job…but that has not been happening for months as I am not getting anywhere with my applications.

If you were in my situation what would you do, considering the current market?"

Severance Package,"Hi all!

Recently got laid off, not because of anything I did (at least not from what HR told me when they gave me the documents for severance package), but due to company reducing their corporate employees count.

I'm getting 2 weeks in lieu of notice, plus 2 weeks compensation (less applicable stats), plus any unused vacations accrued. 

In addition, they are giving 5 weeks salary of additional notice once I sign.

For background, I am between 20-30 years of age, and have been working with the company for 2-3 years. 

Is this severance package OK or should I have a lawyer consult.
I have been reading that I should never sign severance packages until I get legal advise, but they are all 350-600 per consultation. The free consults are all booked up and next available openings are in 1-2 months.

Hope someone can help!

Edit : spelling corrections

Update : I have negotiated prior to signing and got another 2 weeks added to the severance, no lawyers were met :). I asked them to remove what I didn't need in the compensation benefit and transfer it to cash. I also highlighted my contributions to my team and the company. Chat gpt was my best friend in creating the negotiating letters - you can keep inputting non confidential info until you get the right counter letter.
Lay offs have been crazy since I posted. I hope this helps others!
Thank you everyone, I appreciate all the replies and advice!"
Second Wave of Optum Layoffs Despite Strong Growth in 2023,"On October 26, 2023, Optum, a part of the healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group, proceeded with a second wave of employee layoffs. This development is particularly striking given the company's strong financial performance in the third quarter of 2023. UnitedHealth Group reported a 14% increase in revenue to $92.4 billion, with both Optum and UnitedHealthcare experiencing double-digit growth. Operational earnings also saw a significant rise to $8.5 billion.

Amidst these positive financial results, UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty commented, ""As a result of our colleagues’ steadfast focus on helping people access and receive the care they need, we are well-positioned to help even more people and continue to generate strong, diversified growth in the coming years.""

Despite these affirmations of growth and stability, the decision to reduce the workforce has been made, even as CEO Andrew Witty's compensation was reported at $18.4 million for the previous year. This juxtaposition has led to discussions about the potential for executive pay cuts to avert such extensive layoffs.

The pattern of layoffs at Optum seems to echo a trend identified by Stanford Business Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer, who has termed the widespread job cuts across the tech industry as “social contagion,” suggesting that companies may be influenced to lay off workers because it has become a prevalent response, not necessarily because of financial exigency.

For more information on UnitedHealth Group's financial outcomes and executive compensation, please refer to the following resources:

Recently Laid Off: Annual performance + bonus transparency,"Hey! I was just hit by one of the recent big company tech layoffs. The severance package seems fair and it was stated that I would still receive an annual bonus.

During the meeting with manager and HR, I asked if I would receive my 2023 performance review and was told no: performance reviews will be completed and recorded, but will not be provided to us.  

The amount of our annual bonus is based on a combination of individual performance and company performance. 
All of the communication emphasizes that these layoffs were a business decision and not due to performance, and I am highly confident I did not underperform. However it seems there's nothing preventing my manager from assigning me a ""did not meet"" rating in order to balance the bell curve towards rewarding team members that weren't laid off.

With the receipt of this bonus, I don't expect that they will report my performance rating or details of the bonus calculation. 

Additionally, I've been assured that I am eligible for re-hire, but I would expect a low performance rating to impact my actual chances of being rehired.

Is there a legal obligation for them to provide me my performance records? 

If they did, what options do I have to dispute the rating as a former employee?"

A Rant and Observation: The layoff cycle,"I’ve seen it 3 times around and missed 2 layoffs cycles already, but got bit this time around unfortunately.

The way I see it is that it is a fearful time of the cycle. And it goes like this:

Economy Fear; C-Suite Panic; Layoff Folks regardless of if the company is inept or not.
Economy turns, and they can’t hire fast enough.

Wash; Rinse; Repeat

In my situation, the company was inept, but generally the organizations start hiring over seas. I think this is how the next few years are going to play out.

My issue with overseas talent; specifically India, is that the “talent” is either inept or apathetic, or both. There are a few diamonds in the rough, but it’s far and few in between. If I had to make a percentage, it would be about 10-15%.

With AI and Chat GPT though, I think more programming can be done in-house rather than off-shored.

In the battle between artificial intelligence, ChatGPT vs offshore labor, AI generally knows what I’m referring to, generally competent, and also available immediately.

It doesn’t mean that AI can respond to a production outage etc… but still for development and speed of time to market for a feature, the AI driven development is very quick.

Anyone else have observations within this market also like this?

Career Advice post Layoff,"43M – Ontario: I got laid off Dec 2023. Worked more than 5 years in an IT company managing software product implementations. Company losing clients, revenue down, merged with another company and new management took over.

I took the time to rest, regain my health and enjoy the time with family in Dec. Job market is terrible since January. I’ve been debating on where to focusing my career to get a better employment opportunity.

Option 1 - Project management and PMP certification since this is more related to my recent work experience. I have no formal PM education.

Option 2 - Pursue a specialized IT field such as Big Data Analytics, Cybersecurity or AI.

I can also apply for Better Jobs Ontario to get a Diploma on the fields above.

Question to all – Is specialized IT field worth it? Per my observations (correct me if I’m wrong). IT pay is high however, there is a risk in terms of job security. For a certain number of years, there is always something going on in the industry that leads to layoffs. I am learning towards a steady income with job security.

Thoughts and advise please. Thanks."

Corporate Welfare ranked,
What would you do? ,"
So I am self taught developer. I got a job during the “easy times” to get hired (early 2022), then after six months to avoid a lay off (startup was laying off most of the devs) I switched departments within the same company to work as a UX Designer (should have looked for another SWE job back then and was getting recruiters reach out to me for 150k/200k jobs but that’s another story). 

Anyways, I recently got laid off (while pregnant, yes that sucked big time). Baby is now 4 months old.

I have an associates in Design and I’m thinking of getting my Bachelors in CS (which I applied to in 2013 but decided to do something else back then which I really regret, but that’s also another story..)

I am 38. I want to get back to SWE and need to improve on my coding skills. Yes, I’m looking for a job now in this crazy market. 

Questions are: 

- Should I get my Bachelors to improve my chances BUT take it while taking care of a baby full time? 
Note: I already have an associates so that would take around 2-3 years. 

OR…

- Should I do a free bootcamp or back to self teach just to improve on my skills but not commit to a Bachelors just yet while baby is small? 

OR…

- Should I go back to self teaching FOR NOW while baby is small and try and get a job that way and if that doesn’t work then pursue my Bachelor when baby is bigger? 



—— Things to consider: 

1- My field is in Blockchain and Smart Contracts and I’ve been in this field for over 3 years, so my competition is not the same most people in this sub are dealing with I’m assuming. 

2- My partner is supporting me now but money is tight and I need and want a job. 

Thanks in advance!

So Hows the Job Hunting Going,"This is one dreaded question.   I get this in some frequency from my son and his wife, both wfh.  All I can say is:  ""I Just keep on applying"" .  Even if I go down the path of a thoughtful recap of the job market, it falls on deaf ears.    "
Why do they do this shit? Company that acquired my old company and laid me off before just acquired current company and has been gaslighting and dancing around layoffs for weeks,Those “new names” and faces are overseas workers. We aren’t stupid. In fact I think it was even dumb of her to send this email because she basically just admitted people will be laid off and that they’re already hiring overseas people to replace us. I’m just bitter because I went through this same shit with this company before and hate the irony that they acquired my current company and are probably going to do the exact same thing. It’s such a large company they just eat up all the smaller ones and eventually they will probably own them all.
What happens to your mortgage after layoff?,"Hi. For those who are in Canada, when you get laid off and lose your job and you don’t have income or savings, what happens to your mortgage? Is there such a thing that you can pause your payment just til you get a new job?"
Does the Job Search make you Depressed?,"I have to say the job search has made me depressed and really low self esteem.

I know you aren't supposed to let your job define you... but how can this process not make you frustrated?

Does anyone else have this after getting laid off?"

How bad is it to have multiple short term stints on your resume in tech?,"Be honest.

I have 

Job a - 2 years
Job b - 2.5 years 
Job c - 1 year 
Job d- 1.5 year ( currently)

Is it better to stretch out job d for 2 years? How does a hiring manager feel about it? I don’t really like my current job and took it out of desperation so I’d prefer to keep a shorter stint but I know I have to play resume optics"
Layoff package,"EDIT: I was able to get the cash in place of healthcare and outplacement services. This layoff was part of a reorganization between my former company and an acquiring company. So, please do not assume the acquiring company is unhealthy financially, and the layoff is strictly to cut cash now. I work in tech. 

Laid off yesterday. Feels like this package is abt as good as it gets but want to hear what y’all think. Final question and context at the end of the post.

Final Pay: You will receive your final paycheck covering 1/1/24- 1/15/24 with pay through 1/15/24  as well as payout for any unused PTO. You will continue with your company paid insurance coverage through January 31, 2024.

On this final paycheck, your bonus payment of <high dollar amount> will be included. This payment is eligible for 401k contribution and matching. 

Separately, a severance agreement offering you a severance package (described below). One week to sign, and about 5 days from signing until money hits account.


The separation benefits package is comprised of:
Lump sum cash payment in the amount calculated as follows:
3 months base salary 
plus ½ month for each year worked (not to exceed 4 years)
less the amount paid to employees pursuant to the bonus
equals the gross amount to be paid in new money under the severance package.

3 months Company paid health care insurance continuation
3 months Company paid outplacement services provided
Retain possession of your laptop after it has been remotely cleaned of all information


Unemployment Benefits: Company will not deny any claims for Unemployment benefits, if eligible.

Im receiving about 1 month severance as part of this package after we subtract my bonus. Im asking for Cash in place of healthcare and outplacement. What else should I ask for?"
How did you manage stress and job hunt at the same time while under the looming pressure of being let go,"Never thought I would post here. In any case I think I will be on informal PIP come this round of performance review. They cant lay me off right away because 1. My org is the only one budgeted for extreme hiring. We just dont have enough people 2. My boss hasnt had any conversation with me throughout the year on performance issues. My company is a large one and is very particular about following protocols on such things. But never say never.

My question is how many of you got laid off or took a new job due to being burnt off? How long did it take you to find a new job.

I went from a top performing person to avg. I say avg because I was put in a position that didnt let me shine, didnt align with my skill sets and I didnt have the resources to do my job. Things my boss did acknowledge. Felt like he had my back when I was a top performer now not sure. I lobbied hard recently to move to a different role (same org) and got that. I worked on helping hire a new person in my current role. But this company and environment is just not for me anymore. I have lost the desire to work after working 14 hr days. At this point I am just buying time but its becoming clear how I am being perceived by the new leaders. Even though I havent transitioned from my current role I am not being included in conversations. Then I am noticing I am making mistakes. It is what it is, it’s time to move on.

In this environment how did you manage your stress and work on getting a new job? 

My goal is by next 60-90 days I land a new job. Until then I want to start my new role at 80% atleast (new person isnt joining until few weeks later) - which I will insist with my boss and do a decent job. Not ruffle feathers, and leave on a good note.

I’m in Tech and the type of roles I am looking for, I see many openings. So surprisingly I am not too worried. Either I get to maintain my salary in the new job I find or take a pay cut, which is fine by me.

Employer told me to wait to sign my severance agreement?,"I've been informed that I am getting laid off back in November.  I am currently still employed there and working, but my final day will be January 5.  They have given me the draft of the severance agreement which includes a $$ package, but they have insisted that I not sign it until January 5 or afterwards.  Why would they want me specifically to wait to sign?  Why not sign it now?  Is there a catch to this that I'm not picking up on?"
I'm having a tough day,"I have had good and bad days since my layoff one month ago. 

I had a great day a few days ago when I won an award for my work. All of the attention felt great. 

But today is the day my layoff is official. I feel sad, it feels final, I no longer have the award and seeing my people to look forward too, and tomorrow I will go to unemployment. I'm sure there is just letdown following the award too. I also stop getting paid.

I wrote a long post on the jobs reddit about my journey and things that have helped me. I meant every word of it. But I feel alone and overwhelmed today. 

Also in one week is one of the major events of the year in my profession, it was intense, you prepped for it, I even used to take the day off after, and I feel sad about being on the sidelines this time. 

Everybody says you have good days and bad days and today I feel very heavy. "
"Possible layoff incoming at my job, should I look for work elsewhere?","To keep a long story short, I started working in September 2023 of last year at a staffing agency that was fully remote. It was a full-time position temp job that was on contract for a client company. On orientation day they were talking about changes and possibly not doing remote work anymore in April 2024. That was the first red flag that I kept in mind.

As the months went by from Sep-Dec it was really busy and work was usual. Then in Jan. 2024 to Feb. 2024 work started to decrease and we would be released ealier throughout the day and I couldn't get my full 40hrs, a second red flag.

Then I got an email in the middle of March from my staffing agency that my assignment was extended until 3/31/24, right before the month of April that was rumored about since I was hired. A third red flag. I asked them a blunt question on whether this was a layoff and they denied it which I don't believe for a second.

I started looking for work elsewhere and applied to different job opportunities already. But just wanted to know if my gut feeling was right on the mark?"

Got laid off - should I lie on resume? ,"
Just got laid off a week ago, starting the process of updating my resume. I’m not sure if I should put on my resume that I’m no longer working at that role or if I should leave it as “present” as if I’m still working there. I know it’s risky but I know candidates that are employed are more attractive than unemployed. Also if I say I’m still employed there, won’t that discourage prospective employers reaching out to verify? What y’all think? "

Advice on an area to avoid. ,"I'm a life long government contractor to various agencies.   I was recently laid off from a contract that most thought was stable.  When it happened I started asking around to various people I have connected to throughout life and learned something that could be helpful.   

Right now avoid US Army contract work.  Other branches and agencies are not having the same budget issues they are at the moment.   There are significant cuts happening and upcoming in the Army specifically that at least for now are not impacting others.  
We sat in a building with a group doing similar work for the Air Force, and most of the people laid off from my group went there because while Army was losing funding, Air Force was issuing new contracts.  

Just a heads up that might be helpful to some."

Current interview question,"I was laid off at the beginning of February, and I'm currently in the interview process at a different company.

I haven't updated my LinkedIn to mention anything about the layoff, and haven't mentioned as it hasn't come up yet but I've been laid off from my last company.

I have a second round of interviews coming up, and I'm sure that they will ask me why I left my last job that should I told them that I was laid off at the beginning of the month? Or just avoid it and say that I was looking for a change?

If more time had passed I wouldn't mind commenting that I was a part of the layoffs but since the timeline of this interview is aligning with my layoff I just feel weird about it.

Getting laid off and applying for another internal position. Do I mention it?,"I work for a large-ish bank in the mortgage division. Last month, I was given 60 days notice that my position is being eliminated due to…well… lack of work for everyone. 

I have an interview Friday for another internal position, not in mortgage. My question- when they inevitably ask “why are you looking to leave your current position”, should I just be upfront about the impending layoff? I don’t think it’s any secret that mortgage lenders are laying off across the country, so I don’t want to look like I’m hiding something or giving some BS answer. 

I love working for this company, so my preference really would be to stay here. The benefits are better than anything I’ve had before. If we have to switch to the insurance at my husband’s job, our monthly premium will be 4x what we pay now. 

So, would you be upfront about switching roles due to upcoming layoff, or stick with “looking for a new challenge” type answer?

Thank you

Edit: to add, my concern with just saying I’m looking for a new challenge or growth is that the position I’m applying for would not really be growth from the position I’m currently in. There would be no pay increase either. I started out as a branch associate for 3.5 years. I have now been in mortgage for about 3.5 years. Will it look like I’m just job hopping every few years when I get bored, or am I overthinking it? "

Layoff Tension after Company Acquisition,"Hello My Dear Redditors,  
In January 2023, my company was acquired by one of the WITCH companies, and the integration process is underway. They have set the cutover date for January/February 2025. I'm extremely anxious about potential layoffs. My mind is constantly preoccupied with thoughts of being laid off and having to switch companies😬😰 .

They acquired my company primarily for expansion into the European region, while I am part of the US team, comprising only 50 employees. Following the acquisition announcement, 10% of employees opted to move to another company. My manager and others are assuring us that there won't be any layoffs. They acquired us for our talent and are even offering hikes (although this is the part that worries me), and they're discussing measures to prevent employee attrition.

Currently, I have a project, and I think I'm secure, but I'm not entirely confident. Any developer could potentially do my job for less pay. I have 5 years of experience as a AWS JAVA dev and have been trying for another job for the past two months, but I'm not receiving any calls.

What will my situation be after the cutover?"

Laid off In January,"I was laid off from my dream job in January. I worked there for 5 years and 5 months. It took me about 7 or 8 years to even land that job after I graduated college and that's not an exaggeration. I have the receipts, 14 times applied and rejected. But I did finally get hired and it was exactly what I needed and wanted. I excelled there and was promoted in 3 consecutive years. But I still got laid off because that's how things go in tech during an economic downturn. They layoff thousands of people, for pretty much no reason other than to slow their stock from bleeding out too far.   


So, we're in March now, I accepted a new job offer and start in April but I'm still crazy depressed.

Also no hike but gave same pay as my last job. Of course I was angry but i already knew in my head that the recruiter would take advantage of me because of my gap and lack of remote jobs in my area.

How to get back in my feet again,"Dear All, 

I hope you are doing well, 

I got terminated on March 23 and it turns out it was wrongful termination (bc I studied the law)  

So I started to litigate against my ex-employer and didn't sign anything, the HR didn't like my behavior so he got very upset with me bc I sent 800 emails only to get the experience certificate that I needed to apply for jobs.

(Remember guys don't sign anything until seeking advice from an employment lawyer practicing the law in your state)

He refuses to hand that certificate until the court decides on the case, 

In October 2023, the appeal court decided to rule in favor of me. 

In November 2023, HR finally sent it to me The experience certificate. 

Now In Feb 2024, I need to get back on my feet again and commence Job haunting. 

Today, I talked with the Recruiter he told me working as a freelancer “shows no commitment from your side unfortunately it will be hard to be employed again. ”, I felt like that I ruined my whole career and didn't have any future at all. 

For the freelancer Job, I would say it makes a barely decent living, but I Do need to secure my financial status. 

I mean I'm not living on my savings during the whole year of 2024


What do you think guys? Is it will be hard to get back on my feet again?

Does this mean a layoff is coming?,"I work for a start up we had a lay off last year where they let go 30 people

They removed all the open positions 

Performance reviews are coming up but I don’t think anyone is expecting a raise. 

We’ve been waiting for our new goals and objectives since January and haven’t received anything 

They cancelled the leadership meetings for my managers

They haven’t released the budget, basically said just budget for last year.


We had our company meeting and honestly there wasn’t a lot of transparency in terms of what’s going on but I’m expecting to be laid off as my position is redundant I do support and there are maybe 3 of us already.

So I’m the odd duck out as I was the last hired, I’m also a POC and woman. 

I’m just looking for tips on how to prepare before the inevitable occurs…I know the job market is tough…maybe I’ll go back to school for nursing"
Request to provide industry with every post,There is blood in the water! Depression is here!  Etc. We’ve all seen these posts but I have not seen people discussing what areas or industries these are happening in. Are the posts heavily by people in tech? Is it a different industry? I’d like to know because it also helps us understand context
my finding work tip...,"I was in a well paid tech role that 'did not work out' the why is kinda irrelevant.. trust me I did absolutely nothing wrong.. I was just not allowed to stay past probation..I just didn't fit in.

Tbh I was glad because I did not like my boss either. So it was mutual I guess.

Anyroad the reality was I was looking at mortgage to pay etc.. and prospect of what little savings I had running out fast..

Now I know times are different now.. but still it knocks your confidence to have that kind of departure.

Anyhow I had a friend who worked in food and while I was interviewing I worked for him for just £10 per hour., For a few shifts a week.
It was hard, fun manual labour with lots of customers to deal with and thinking on your feet.. it was fun long hours.
For 3 months I was doing an odd shift here and there.. some festivals too..

Not because I needed the money but because I needed to work.

I am telling you it helps.. I even built soft skills doing it.

 It's one of the reasons the job I have today called me back.. they asked me about why I would do such a job when I could go for something better paid.

So if you are laid off.. wondering what to do go and work for pennies while you do your interviews and job hunting.. doesn't have to be full time..you can even volunteer..

It will help your confidence, you may even surprise yourself what you can do..

And most of all it will help you stand out amounts the 10000s of layoff applications.

Because right now there are a lot so the story of ""Salesforce laid me off"" will get old quick.. unfortunately.

Best of luck peeps 

Remember you are not crap, you were just crapped on by organizations who are used to getting free money.. and that money has stopped."

I suspect three ""fake"" brown recruiting companies have done this just to edit the resumes and certs with different names.  
        
How to handle this and tips?  
            
I plan on directly applying for the roles but not sure if it's too late or if I should notify the companies.

Should I apply elsewhere?,"I've been working for a company for about 1.5 years.  I've had 2 other jobs in the past 3 years after relocating for my wife's job.  Each one I left because either because the company was looking to sell off the business (layoff potential), or management was terrible.  I feel like I've had a rough go of things.

The company I work for laid off 10% of the work force last year, then another noticeable amount in the past few weeks.  Sales are down.  They were going to eliminate my position too, and then ask me to move to another, which would have been fine, but then decided to keep my position.

HR told me they kept me because they liked me, and they had another position open so they would use me to fill it.  It's still open.  I found out that another review is coming in April, but they're expecting demand to get better in the summer. So, lot's of uncertainty and no guarantees.

I've wanted to stay with a company for at least a few years to decide if I want to stay for the long-term, and I'm worried I'll just get perceived as a job hopper that nobody wants.  Nevertheless, it can take a few months to find a new job in the event of layoff.  I have savings to handle that, but obviously want to avoid using it.

I figure I have 3 options.  1) Stay and wait.  2) Go to HR to see if I can move to the other position, which is really needed, at the risk of making some upper management angry that vouched for my position.  3) Look elsewhere while waiting.

Thoughts?

"C-Suite Self Promoting, Employees Applying for Unemployment ","I worked for a company not too long ago where they had something like 5 layoffs in 12 months, and I got caught up in the “final one”. I’ve written on here about how I handled it and how lucky I was to find a great job in a short time. This week a former colleague called me in the middle of their All Hands to tell me there is ANOTHER layoff, and she is impacted. I log on to LinkedIn to see all of these hardworking people blindsided. I know you can never feel safe, but these were people who survived the “final” layoff. Anyway, what really pissed me off was the first LI post I saw from a C-Suite at that company was all self promotion and posted right around the time people found out about the layoffs. Not a single word about the dozens of people now faced with uncertainty, not a recommendation to hire the “unfortunate rockstars caught up in today’s RIF”, just “I’m excited to announce I’m keynoting the XYZ conference”. 

Sorry that was a bit of a rant, I’m just disgusted by it all."
"Leadership stock sell off, warning signs?","My start-up has gone through 3 rounds of layoffs in the past year.  In two of those rounds, members of the c-suite who were to be laid off executed/sold a number of shares in the months preceding their layoff announcement.  There has been large amounts of stock shares from a few of our c-suite members sold in the past two months, and has me worried more layoffs are coming.  In this case the large amount of insider selling had a positive affect on stock price which is what had me and some colleagues digging.  Is this a common practice to free up large amounts of available shares/manipulate stock price?"

Illinois Remote WARN Notice,Does anyone here have a good understanding of the WARN notice for remote workers in Illinois?  I was just layed of by a company that let go of 600+ remote workers from all over the US but mainly IL with no warning. The layoff was due to outsourcing to other countries.
Anticipating redundancy soon. Will you buy vested stock options?,"I work at a private tech company, headquartered and founded in the US. Am based in APAC. 

Anticipating redundancy soon as my business vertical is closing down and I literally have no work these days (not sure why company is still keeping me on the payroll, but I'm not complaining). 

When I joined my current co, I was given stock options. As I've been with the co for 2.5 years, I have some vested stock options. I checked and I have up to 90 days to decide whether to exercise them, if I leave the company (whether forced or voluntarily). 

Should I purchase my vested stock options? Company is growing at quite an okay pace, and it has IPO ambitions. Then again, most companies say this so I'm quite skeptical about it. Plus the market is not conducive for IPO these days and my company has had IPO ambitions for 2 years. Though given the size it is, an exit (either going public or getting acquired) is probably the only way out in the next couple of years. 

Or should I forgo the vested stock options and save the $$$ for other means (eg. savings, other investments), especially if it may take me some time to find a job after redundancy? A bird in the hand can be worth 2 in the bush. 

Would love any thoughts / suggestions / recommendations, thanks in advance! "

"*PAYPAL TO CUT WORKFORCE BY ABOUT 9%, AFFECTING ROUGHLY 2,500","PayPal Holdings Inc. will reduce its workforce by about 9% this year as Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss, who took over in September, grapples with rising competition, profit pressures and a raft of analyst downgrades.

In a letter to staff on Tuesday, Chriss said the decision was made to “right-size” the company through both direct cuts and the elimination of open roles throughout the year. Affected staff will be notified by the end of the week, according to the letter, which was seen by Bloomberg News. 

PayPal, which employed around 29,900 workers at the end of 2022, announced a similar round of cuts last January. The latest move will affect about 2,500 workers.

Eliminating jobs will allow the firm to “move with the speed needed to deliver for our customers and drive profitable growth,” Chriss said in the letter. “At the same time, we will continue to invest in areas of the business we believe will create and accelerate growth.”

Shares of the payments giant have plunged more than 20% over the past year as earnings faltered and the company lowered its full-year guidance for adjusted operating margin. PayPal named Chriss last year to replace Dan Schulman.

PayPal was an early disrupter in the payments industry, but rivals including Apple Inc. and Zelle have since crowded the space, leaving PayPal struggling to keep pace. At least four analysts downgraded the stock this month, citing a range of concerns from rising competition to pressure on profitability.

Chriss said on PayPal’s third-quarter earnings call that the firm’s “cost base and complex structure” had slowed progress, an issue he plans on addressing to boost the firm’s operating leverage. The San Jose, California-based company is set to report fourth-quarter results next week.

“There hasn’t been a lot to celebrate” over the past few years, Chriss told CNBC earlier this month.

Since Chriss took the helm, he’s revamped PayPal’s leadership roles and made clear that he plans to streamline what grew into a bloated business during the pandemic. "
Is this a sign or am I overthinking,"I’m trying to figure out if I’m overthinking this or is this a sign that I’m about to be layoff. 

Follow me here. And thanks for reading. 

I’m in account management and been in my role for 10 years and am very good at my job in fact just 3 months ago was awarded a very high award for excellence at my company. 

But at the same time a merger was happening between my biggest account and another big account. My account was the one that got bought out. 
 
(Side Note: the company is a Fortune 500 but has had a very very bad year lost millions upon millions of dollars in sales in 2023 and many people have already been laid off already.)

I was told that the person that was servicing the other account was going to take over full duties for them going forward. Since they have been service the parent company for many more years than I have been. This was 3 months ago. 

I still have smaller accounts that work on but no where near the size of the one I was taken off of. I’m currently working on a project with one of the smaller accounts that will take a lot of work and a lot of time dedication on my end but is expected to be finished in March. 

I was just informed by my manager that I will be leaving their team around the March timeframe but was reassured that I’m not being laid off. The VP and I have worked on many projects and he completely trusts me. I was told that in that meeting between my manager and VP the VP said I was too good for these smaller accounts and I’m being wasted here (I agree). So he wants to move me to bigger accounts. (According to my manager)

But every time I ask what account I’m going to be assigned too nobody knows. Or at least they don’t tell me. All I hear is you have nothing to worry about. 

Am I just being paranoid here thinking they just need me to complete this difficult assignment that’s scheduled to be finished in March then I’m going to be laid off?  Or is it truly just in my head and you think I’m going to be fine."

"Boom! Google’s AR Org Explodes, Engineers Laid Off, VP Chills at Meta","TL;DR Paul Greco, Google’s VP quit, and left behind a trail of chaos and a bunch of talented folks jobless, while he's already chilling at Meta with a fancy new VP title.

Holy smokes! Paul Greco, VP of Google’s AR organization, just nuked the entire Org and vanished like a ghost. Not only did he drop the ball on everything, but he brought in his posse of Magic Leap know-it-alls – walking Dunning-Kruger disasters, the lot of them – and watched the whole thing crash and burn quicker than a damp sparkler. Instead of owning his mess like a decent human, Greco did what any self-respecting exec does: secured a cushy VP gig at Meta (seriously, Meta?!). Talented engineers and scientists? Laid off. Greco? Sunsets on Zuckerberg's yacht.

It's mind-blowing. How does Meta, supposedly a tech giant, hire someone who just nuked a competitor? And hand him the keys to their own AR team? It's like watching a toddler play with a box of matches at a gas station. Unbelievable! doesn't even cut it."
Writing on the wall?,"My current company, like many others, reluctantly went full remote during the pandemic.  They then started hiring people fully remote saying they had no plans to RTO.  They just recently announced a new hybrid policy.  They are not currently planning to force remote workers to move, but those who are already near an office will be required to do hybrid work.

I am fully remote and have no plans to move anywhere near the existing offices.  My concern is that this is step one to full RTO / forced quitting to avoid them having to actually do lay offs and pay out severance.  Anyone else seen a similar pattern that either lead to forced RTO or actual layoffs?

Financially the company is “okay”, but growth has stagnated.  This is why I’m thinking they might drop some workers to make their profits look better.  Should I start interviewing?"

Lump-sum severance + new job,I was laid off and signed an agreement that has no mention of what happens if i accept a new position. I knew this was coming though and have already accepted an offer. Can my past employer hold back the lump-sum payment or request it be returned once they realized I've already found a new position?
This is BS- companies should not eliminate a bunch of jobs then post openings for the same jobs a few months later,"I’m sick of companies doing this- using these mass layoffs as a way for cowardly managers to get rid of people they don’t like because they can’t get them out based on performance. How is it possible that companies allow this- eliminate a position and then 3 months later you add basically the exact same position with a slightly different title on the same team.  It’s ridiculous but not surprising. Companies- stop letting your middle managers treat business like the cast of Mean Girls. Ok, rant over."
Layoffs,"From the recent layoffs I have been hearing a lot about how companies are treating laid off candidates atrociously, low-balling offers and taking forever to make offers.

How to structure severance on a new position?,"I was laid off from my director level remote job last year, and it took about 6 months to find a new position. They gave me 70% of my PTO and no severance which sucked. I'm in a right to work state so you're SOL if a company decides to downsize. 

I took a step down and took a manager level position in a similar field. I was contacted by a recruiter to interview with a great company and a VP level position. My question is, should/can I negotiate my comp package for the new position to include a severance package? This is in the home building industry so I'm not sure if it's feasible. What is a standard way to structure severance on the front end of a job? It seems like asking upfront is a little bit of a red flag to the company that it will be hard to get rid of you. I'm desensitized by the fickle real estate industry so I'm not sure how it's done elsewhere."
Trends…,"I don’t follow layoffs closely (on the internet or irl), but I’ve got a a question about the mass layoffs in the tech industry lately…

Before these mass layoffs, was there a period maybe 2-3 years prior where layoffs were happening more discretely, at a slower rate, but still shrinking. As I’m not replacing those employees.

Are these mass layoffs all at once a surprise that’s all just coming seemingly out of nowhere, or was there a trickle, and then a stream of layoffs, and the hole in the damn just can’t be plugged now?

Hope my question makes sense. Sorry if this isn’t sub appropriate. "

"Trying to get old job back, getting ghosted","I was laid off in October by a company I really loved working for. My performance was great but the small team I was on was targeted for layoffs. I’ve interviewed at a few companies but was denied after the final stage. Two weeks ago I decided to check my old company’s career page and saw a role in my larger department posted so I reached out to my old team lead who took an internal transfer. She referred me and I met with the recruiter last week, and we scheduled a call with the hiring manager for last Friday. 

Now, of all the hiring managers in the department, this is the one I know the least but my reputation was pretty good and the recruiter and my old boss seemed very positive on my chances. The manager interview went well and the hiring manager even responded to my follow up thank you email. She said she was traveling this week, but the recruiter told me she’d get back to me ASAP, possibly even last Friday, so I expected Tuesday at the latest. It’s Thursday afternoon and even after a follow up with the recruiter, I haven’t heard anything.

I have another phone screen tomorrow, but I really wanted to go back to my old company. I talked to other people I worked with and they all were very supportive of me returning. I also found out that someone who took over some of my accounts was let go for performance, and I could slide right back in to where I left off. I know it’s a tough market out there but I honestly can’t believe I haven’t heard anything.I even applied to another role my old manager referred me to and haven’t gotten a response on that. I’m lucky that I got a great severance and final bonus, and have great UI in my state. But this is the most discouraged I’ve been since getting laid off and the waiting game has been paralyzing.

Thanks for letting me vent. Good luck to everyone in your searches!"
Algo to beat layoffs risk,"We need to fight the system else this is horrible for us and our children's future.

1. Do the bare minimum. They can't put everyone on pip. They are forced  to hire more.
2. Only ask easy interview questions. Employers dont interview employees do.  Make it so that anyone can clear an interview. No stress even if you are fired or laid off as next gig atleast will be easy to clear. 
3. Negate AI threat. Not an expert here but if ai runs on data ..if input data is bad ai responses are bad..
4. Negate outsourcing threat..deny meetings in non US hours.


We need to lower the bar of job performance and interviews. We need solidarity to beat this system else we are just reduced to commodity."
"Day 9 since layoff, was feeling confident now I'm spiraling, considering freelance","I was laid off from a creative middle management (art) role a little over a week ago and off the bat I was feeling pretty confident at first but now with 10 apps out, 3 of which i have personal network connects that work at the office that referred me with the hiring manager. Haven't heard anything yet, not sure how quick these things often happen as this role I got as a recruiter reached out to me, while I was still employed at my last gig. My book and background is strong, I have no concerns about that. 

Since connecting with some of my network I have 3-4 handful of freelance ops offered to me, one being a 3 month contract with an old boss I LOVE. I did freelance as a secondary income to a full time work before I was married and had kids and it was fine. I didn't even make enough to need to file quarterly. I know in my heart of hearts I would never make as much freelancing or even come close to my full time income, which is ok for now. I'm also afraid to do freelance, especially longer term contracts than if a job does come along I can't say yes because of prior commitments. I would still pursue full time employment. 

But at the same time, I'm afraid of not contributing to my family. We are closing on a house next week (truly, a nightmare time to get laid off, as it usually is) and having 6+ figures gone feels like, a huge loss for everything I pictured for my family.

TL;DR - Pick up freelance vs not and stay only on the hunt "

On Monday, the company’s new CEO decided to layoff 15% of the workforce, equating to around 400 employees. I was included in this.

I know I am new to the corporate world, but this seemed unique to me. Why would they bring me on 2 weeks ago to immediately release me, especially when rejecting me from the role could have saved the company money on severance pay? If the new CEO was planning this shift, why even go through the effort of signing my offer letter?

What got you here won't get you there,"This statement holds true for many employees who have been impacted by recent layoffs. The skills and experience that helped you succeed in your previous role may not be enough to secure your next opportunity. Especially for those who have been the manager's favorite, it's time to start thinking about how you can reinvent yourself and stand out in a competitive job market. Embrace new skills, explore new industries, and don't be afraid to take on new challenges. Remember, the only constant in life is change and the ability to adapt to it will determine your success."
"Laid product management leaders, did you find your next role?","I was laid off early last year from a Bayarea startup. Except for few consulting gigs, I haven't found a full-time yet. I have not applied to down level roles and been mostly targeting Dir+ titles. I am not sure how the market is honestly as it has not been kind to me unfortunately. I have more than 15+ yoe.

New direction? ,"I found out around a month ago that I will be let go. It was almost a mutual decision with zero hard feelings whatsoever. 

Here’s the thing. I am in my late 40’s and have been in the same industry for around the past 20 years. I am beyond done with this line of work and want to do something completely different, of which I am uncertain about as of yet. I feel like I have pigeonholed myself into a very specific niche (drug safety reporting/medical litigation research) and don’t really fit the needed qualifications for any other field. 

I am trying to realize my value and how I can transfer that into another profession. Feeling surprisingly optimistic, as I am prone to depression, but unsure of how to get the ball rolling and progress forward. "
Whirlpool layoff (# unknown),https://abc57.com/news/community-reacts-to-word-of-whirlpool-layoff
Finding a role 12 months after being laid off - Learnings,"Sharing my journey finding a role in the last 12 months.

I have more than a decade of (non-technical) Operations and Trust and Safety experience at FAANG companies. Based in the Bay Area. Got impacted by layoffs. Read ahead if relevant.

Applied mostly for Trust and Safety/Customer Service Operations/PgM type roles and eventually started applying to Sales Operations roles as well. Most initial applications were for Bay Area based roles and eventually expanded to Austin, Seattle, Atlanta, NYC.

Stats:

* 1200+ applications
* 23 recruiter screens
* 17 hiring manager interviews
* 8 full loop interviews
* 3 roles where I ended up as the ‘other finalist’
* 1 conversion; 2 full loops in progress

Also had 6 interviews progressing to various stages with a short-form video hosting service. One full loop. More on this below.

Learnings:

1. Referrals, Referrals, Referrals! - Got 5 recruiter callbacks for direct applications with no referrals. That's 5 callbacks from \~1000 direct applications. My recommendation is to not waste time with direct applications. Always try referrals and if possible, get your referrer to contact the HM. In 99% of the cases, the HM may not respond but that's the way to go.
2. Resume - As all of you might know, shorter the better. 2 pages MAX. For companies that use Workday and some other job portals (Uber, Meta, for example), I had two versions:
   1. A txt/docx version which had much more detail, was longer and had more keywords. This helps with ATS shortlisting your resume and in cases where resume screening is outsourced (Google, Meta), helps if the screener does ctrl+F to look for keywords from JD in your resume
   2. A much-shorter pdf version for the HM to review. HMs usually see the past companies and roles along with top 2-3 bullets. Keeping HM resumes short and easy on the eye will help stand out in cases of resume reading fatigue.
3. Customizing resume for every role - It gets extremely exhausting to do this when you are applying to 100s of roles. My learning was to go for referrals and customize resume for every role. Not the entire resume but the headline and a couple of bullets at the least. Tl;dr - Go for referrals, that helps you be selective of the type of roles you want to apply to, customize resume.
4. Networking - Most of the people that helped me were my ex-colleagues who then connected me to someone they knew at a company for referral or a general chat. If you get a connection in a company you are targeting, please set up a chat even if there is no active opening. Keep the lead warm and leverage the referral when a role comes up. I did try cold outreaches, about 90% of the InMails and connection requests went unanswered. A few that answered were willing to provide a referral or agreed to connect.
5. Interviews - repeating the disclaimer that this is my experience. 
   1. I ended up being ‘the other finalist’ in a couple of my earlier applications and post that, my confidence took a nosedive. I felt that I started to sound desperate for a role. In that desperation, I went on the tangent of telling interviewers that I have done a bit of everything. For my last few roles, really had to reel it in and keep intros very relevant to the job and kept answers short.
   2. Instead of speaking about what I did or the scope of my role, switching to how the company benefitted from my role or some of the high level impact my role at the company level worked better. This enables you to use the intro to steer HMs into the line of questioning that you want. Use your intro to show off. Do not hold back and be humble.
6. Agencies reaching out for Contractor roles - Had about 70 applications sent out via recruiting agencies that reached out with ZERO progress. Had secured one interview with the HM who was a no show. The way this works, per some of the conversations I have had is as follows:
   1. Company opens up a contractor role
   2. Contacts 15-20 or up to 30 different agencies to provide a pipeline of candidates
   3. Each agency can only submit ONE resume
   4. Agencies have recruiters whose jobs are to source candidates
   5. These are the folks contacting us and they have a target to meet
   6. Once they secure the RTR, their job is done. We are just a way for the recruiter to meet their targets.
   7. Agencies submit the most qualified resume
   8. Resume reviewed by the hiring company recruiter who does ctrl+F on the resume for skills to match JD
   9. Hiring company recruiter sends maximum of 10 resumes to the HM
   10. HM hires a candidate that they personally know or was recommended by an exec or a colleague
   11. Tl;dr - Do not waste your time. If anyone has had a positive experience and actually got a contract role through an agency, would love to hear more.
7. Experience interviewing with short-form video hosting service 
   1. Overall, they had the best success rate in terms of responsiveness to applications. 
   2. Some interviews were weird, the scope of the roles were changed midway, locations changed, etc. 
   3. \*The was my experience, not generalizing this\* - interacting with APAC based interviewers was challenging. Communication was an issue, the HMs asked about level in my previous company, salary earned, etc. which is not common in US based tech companies.
   4. Had some great interactions for the roles where interviewers (of all ethnicities) were based in the US
   5. They are hiring big time but mostly in Austin and Seattle for non-tech positions. Apply via referral codes that their employees often share on LinkedIn.

Hoping this post will be helpful for a few folks. Believe in yourself, keep iterating your approach and interviewing style. Keep at it, there is hope!

If anyone has questions, feel free to DM and I will try to answer as many as possible."

How did you find your job recently?,"I want to ask IT people how they found their jobs recently.

Did you use:

1. Network. Maybe your ex-colleagues or LinkedIn friends helped you?
2. Automated tools. Did you create/send resumes automatically and eventually find your job?
3. Personal presence. Maybe you walked into company offices and gave them your resume in person :)

These days, the labor market is brutal (layoffs). Would be nice to know how you have found your job these days."
Been there...,"
We work to contribute to the company's overall mission in whatever title and position we are hired for. In times like this, we get laid off. I've been there back in 2016. Instead of getting upset, bitter, angry, and such, let's count it as possible a blessing to come or a blessing in the moment.. 

Here is my short story, in the summer of 2016, I got laid off after less than a year with the school. I wasn't surprised as I saw it coming, but it was my perspective that helped guide me through this all. In the end, I took my vacation as scheduled and went back to work making enough money to pay for my bills. After fours of working and schooling, I achieved my high school dream after twenty years of preparation.

Be of good cheer! Be of good heart! Network with people and places like LinkedIn. People will see things you cannot see in yourself.

Don't be filled with despair...welcome any private messages or comments to this post.

Don't let negativity fill your heart.

That's my two cents."

Dad just got laid off from a hardware company after almost 20 years in the Bay Area.,"He’s approaching retirement age but I think it would be healthier for him to remain in the workforce. But these days Bay Area has become such a rat racing ground it’s hard to find jobs that can stick to 9-5, especially for older less “agile” folks. 

I personally have to work 007 to deliver something that has a chance to see production impact. Everybody around me seems so competitive and laser focused on success.

His layoff seems also triggered by some angry email response in the past from a recently promoted upper chain of command in the company. It’s ironic how his recent boost in productivity didn’t help. 

What do people do usually in his situation? English is limited working proficiency and skill set is limited to plain C and embedded systems. His health also seems frail these days especially after a leg surgery 2 years ago. He maintains a consistent daily walk schedule of about 2-3 miles but seems to be hitting the physical limit.

Thanks a lot."
EY Laying Off Senior People,"EY began laying off senior people this week. My spouse was at top of his level in his group (top bonuses last years, top raises...approx 7%). Signed a multi-million $ project recently. Had another major client request to lead project in last week. Last quarter review glowing. Given random partner bonus in last few weeks. All for not. Laid off. No reason beyond “it’s not for performance.” Apparently all of a sudden don’t have a “future path forward.” All I can think is my spouse makes too much $ per year and partners want their bonuses. Who cares about years of sacrifice and diligence for the company missing years of family obligations to be given the heave ho with no warning."
Laid off yesterday via Google Hangout along with 6 others simultaneously from toxic boss,"Really just posting this to vent, and to validate that the bright-side to this is that I'm not longer in a very toxic work environment. I worked at a small startup as a product designer in NYC. Leadership was so terrible, extreme nepotism. My boss who is the Head of design, would only hire his friends for roles that we didn't need, and would cause extreme chaos and disruption we didn't need. The founders are alcoholics and also only hire their friends, who land in the leadership category. Yesterday I woke up to a calendar invite for a google hangout with my creative team, our lawyer, and my boss (the head of design), who tells us that it is our last day. Instantly we lose our email and slack accounts. No real reason given. This happens all as a group. No time given individually for us to ask questions or no offering of help with letters of recommendations or praise. No word from the founders, who always hide in situations like this. We got a very small severance, which is on a hold until we return our computers. Both yesterday and today, no-one from leadership or the founders haven't reached out to anyone (a total of 22 people got laid off). Some are much more upset than others. I am taking it surprisingly well. A lot of us realize we are happy we aren't in the toxic environment anymore. But some have been with the company since the beginning and we really close to leaders like the head of design, who never reached out to any of us after letting us go.  Hopefully we all make it out of this ok. But for anyone else in similar situations, it doesn't help to be angry or want to retaliate. I know that companies are going through a lot right now."

Price is Wrong Bi$#@!!,"If the Tech Recruiters low ball you first when you ask the compensation…

Block them.

If they say they have an open rate, and then you state your rate and they say it is too high. 

Block them.

When they ask you to work for a previous position you worked 10 years ago, they didn’t read your resume, what are you going to do?

Yup. Block them.

If they are cat phishers…

Block them.

Recruiters will learn that they can’t lowball due to the economy without consequence, and will report this back to their employers, and they will be forced to increase their rates.

Remember, we have power en masse.

And for those that say, but we have to eat…. Fine take the low paying job, and block the next recruiters in line that are lowballing you.

Severance Question,"This is just a question out of curiosity.

I’ve read that some employers aren’t paying severance if you’ve found a new job during the WARN period, I think that’s crazy!! I am keeping my new employment on the down low, just to be safe. "

What sector of jobs are hit the most at present by the layoffs?,"Hi, 

Reading the news of tech layoffs, it seems that most of the jobs that are being made redundant are not primarily in ""tech roles"" but the brunt of the layoffs are being felt in on secondary functions, such as HR, marketing, sales. 

Not saying that operations, R&D, are not being hit, but looking at the stats, it seems the more junior staff are bearing the brunt. 

This is somewhat similar to the IT industry post 2000s and 2006, onwards. At least in my industry, there are not that many people that we can consider juniors (most are mid 30), and even the mid level guys lack the depth and breadth in some of the key skill sets. A lot of the roles are taken by senior guys so not a lot of skill progression for the people below.   "

"Manager wants me to finish my current project quickly, no clear future project","Hi,

I am working as full-time employee (FTE). A few months ago, I created a top-level report that the SVP didn't like (was no problem with it, though), but probably I didn't come across properly. But mainly, there was one thing that SVP asked me to do and I thought I would do later on (big mistake not to take SVP's request, urgently), and she probably got offended by that - & - with her power & position she removed me from that project. 

Now, with a down economy, my company is running -ve profit. They declared 3% layoffs at the start of this year. Till now, only 1 layoff in my department has been heard of. 

**My** **manager is consistently telling me to finish off my current project in 1 month** which is a decently big or midsize project and can take easily monthly to fully complete. He is telling me this is a low-value project, you should not be working on it (I kind of don't care as long as I am working & getting paid). Then he told me I would be working on another project, which the SVP removed me from 6 months ago. This is making things a mess for me. Just now, he told me there was some pushback regarding me onboarding the project (as nobody wants to go against the SVP); he told me that I might just support other person working on this project. This does not make sense; if he is doing the work, then what am I doing? So basically, after finishing this project, I will not have my own project. I need some work to do on daily bases; otherwise, they might think about removing me to save cost. 

By the way, my manager is a nice guy, but I won't be surprised if he pushes me down because that's how the normal world works & at top of all he has very limited control- only control how & what I do 'within' a project. 

I am very concerned, if I lose this job, how will I survive without any in flowing income. I don't think I can do much, except do well whatever comes my way. *Any advise please or share your thoughts!*"

Severance benefits + job offer,"I’m not sure I’m asking the right subreddit so please redirect me if so.

I have about 12 weeks remaining on severance and just accepted a job offer (and background check cleared). My previous employer made it clear that I need to let them know if I accept a job offer so that they cancel my severance benefits (health insurance/dental insurance) immediately. 
However, new job doesn’t start health insurance until month after start date (so I would be without coverage for a month). 

Do I tell previous employer? Will they find out if it don’t? If I do tell, when is the right time to let them know, at least a business day before I start new job? 

I know I can get cobra for a month but it’s expensive… is cobra retroactive so if I do need it then I can get it then?"
"Tip for homeowners, talk to your mortgage servicer about forbearance due to covid related layoffs.","In most cases you can defer your mortgage payments, and even car payments for a minimum of 3 months up to 12 months. I was laid off during the initial covid lay offs almost 2 years ago and it was a huge financial relief. In fact I was able to turn a negative to a positive and increased my overall savings because during the 3 months I was looking for a new role I significantly cut costs from loan deferrals and still collected severance. For mortgages due to recent changes they will also even let you modify your existing mortgage out to 40 years, maintaining your same rate, to make your payments more affordable. My mortgage is now 2.6% for 40 years which is an absolute blessing. 

TLDR; collect yourself and reach out to every single financial obligation you have and see what financial hardship options they have."

"Layoff Limbo: Dodging ‘Restructure’ Rhetoric, ‘Ghost Job’ Gimmicks, and the Severance Hush Money!","Just throwing my two cents out there, but man, I've really had it up to here with all these massive layoffs happening left and right. It’s creating a sea of joblessness and a ton of uncertainty, and I'm just not here for it. Seeing these big companies pull out the same old excuses like “we’re restructuring,” “downsizing,” or talking about “economic instability” just adds insult to injury.

What’s really getting to me is how they lay off a bunch of people and then, almost immediately, they’re back at it, posting the same jobs they just cut. It makes you wonder, doesn’t it? If they're really in such a tight spot economically, why are they in such a rush to flood the job market and make everything seem hunky-dory??.. smh

And don’t even get me started on these “ghost jobs.” If this is all just a big show for the investors, how come no one is calling these companies out? Why isn't anyone being held responsible for tossing out job listings like confetti, but not actually hiring anyone?

Watching all these layoffs happen one after another, and seeing how ""generous"" they are with the severance packages, it’s hard not to be cynical. We all know that money comes with strings attached, and it’s pretty much their way of keeping people quiet.

I'm just saying, there’s no way all of this is just because of AI and the changes it's bringing to the job market. There's got to be more to it..

What's your thoughts?"

Layoffs.fyi refuses to acknowledge Red Canary layoffs,"Hi there I was wondering if anyone had advice for me. In January, Red Canary, an MDR solution based in Denver CO, laid off off 15% of its staff including myself. I’ve tried multiple times to get it tracked on layoffs.fyi. I’ve sent in links to LinkedIn posts and a screenshot of the email they sent us. I’ve reached out to Lee on LinkedIn. All I get in return is radio silence. I want to get them tracked mostly out of bitterness, they only gave us 4 weeks of severance if we were there for a year, gave us an extra month of healthcare and a paltry amount of options. They told us repeatedly they wouldn’t do layoffs and that they were doing great. I feel like they’re getting away with it because the way they did it was so sneaky and it was never announced formally by the company, I don’t even see it on any WARN lists."

Laid off twice in 10 months,"Title says it all, I got laid off in April of last year at a bad job that I was planning to quit but they beat me to the punch. I found a job after 6 weeks at a start up that was well financed with a good position in a new market. 

Well they laid me off about 2 weeks ago with no notice, severance, or indication that they would be closing the company down. While I was there I constantly pushed for us to develop new products to help us be more competitive, but the owner figured it would just be cheaper to roll my job into someone else's and do nothing to help sell. When I was let go, we had released ZERO new products. 

I've been applying at jobs but have become jaded and bitter, I had a phone interview today that was miserable and we'll below what I used to make. 

I'm split between getting another shitty job and saying fuck it and collecting a paycheck, or trying to find some job that inspires me to be better. Either way I'm bored as hell and don't even have a plant at home to keep me company. "

Lay Off Extra Cash while utilizing UI Benefits,"I am joining the camp of folks recently laid off. I’ve seen the countless stories on here of folks having a hard time in this market and am obviously concerned. I was a first time PM at a startup for about 15 months and delivered 14 features in that time (12 with significant upside metrics). I’ve also got 4 years of product adjacent (roadmapping/user stories/req’s etc) experience but with only 1 year of actual PM experience it may be tough especially for more junior roles. Thankfully I’ve got experience in customer success/account management in senior roles, can likely do technical acct mgmt now that I’ve been a PM or program management. I’m open.

I purchased a house last year and unemployment benefits will cover the mortgage, and I’ve got enough cash to survive about 10-12 months without touching retirement accounts. My expenses run about 6k/mo including an $800 car payment (royally stupid I know but I love my car and life is short). Was just recently thinking about selling it and getting a cash car cuz I’m sick of payments but I’m underwater and now don’t have money to buy one in cash. So I think I’m stuck. Having no car isn’t an option because of where I live. My car was my splurge, I otherwise eat at home and live a pretty frugal lifestyle other than the occasional Scott’s cheap flights travel. I’ll likely rent out my office/2nd bedroom if I’m not seeing traction in the next few months.

My question is, are there ways to make money in cash that don’t affect unemployment? I don’t want to burn all my cash if possible but need the 4k to pay my mortgage and can pinch off 2k from savings for a bit. This is the first time I’ve ever been laid off so I’m kinda freaking out but glad I’ve been decently diligent about saving, although hindsight is 20/20 and wish I had saved more. Any advice on how to weather this storm is certainly welcomed.

Obviously any leads or referrals will be GREATLY appreciated. Would love to connect. Thanks yall!"

Was I laid off?,"Hello everyone. I have a question for you. About six months ago, I was let go from a company of about 200 people. I am curious to hear your thoughts regarding the circumstances of me being let go.

&#x200B;

One day, I was summoned into a conference room, where my manager and an HR person were sitting. My manager proceeded to tell my how my performance was sub par, and that I would be let go due to performance reasons.

&#x200B;

This was very strange. I wasn't an exemplary employee, but I wasn't a poor performer either. I got a 4 out of 5 on my first perfromance review, and a 3 out of 5 on my second one. 3 means ""meets expectations.""

&#x200B;

I began to suspect that this was a layoff in disguise. Here are some facts that may support my claim.

&#x200B;

1. The company underwent financial difficulty and a hiring freeze a month before this happened.
2. My job was never reposted.
3. I caught up with another coworker who left shortly after, and the same exact thing happened to him. He said he was in IT and several other people were let go this way.
4. During the firing meeting, there was a brief moment where the HR lady left the room, and my manager tried to whisper something to me, but I couldn't tell what he tried to say. This is incredibly strange.

&#x200B;

The whole situation was very strange. From my eyes, it seems like the company wanted to perform a layoff without inciting panic among the workers who weren't being let go. Id love to hear your thoughts."

"day 4: im not looking forward to going to work tomorrow, but excited to hear from how many applications ill get","the slow burn of my layoff within the next few days is marinating on my mind and its really bothering me right now. im having a lot of anxiety to go back to work tomorrow and be online for 5 days doing nothing. i know my boss won't have anything for me to do unless it's some crazy ridiculous project that makes no sense to keep me busy and makes me look bad right before my termination. they may even sprinkle some critical comments to make me look bad as well out of the blue. but all I will do is smile, be polite, don't talk too much, and don't go above & beyond. just do what ive been asked to do and if theres nothing tell them im available anytime.

anyways next week's work is going to be torture. But I sent like 50 applications since Friday night. Do the math and with the fact I'm overqualified for the roles I'm applying to suggests I should gear back from 5 - 10 or a 10% - 20% conversion rate. So if my boss has no work for me great, ill focus on these 5 - 10 companies who want to speak with me.

Writing to CEO after layoff,"I was laid off last week. The reason given was ""position elimination."" HR clarified that the action was not performance related. This is weird since I was hired just a few months ago. Our BU head is not strategic and has made similar ""role elimination"" and other rash decisions in the past. I want to inform the company CEO how mismanaged this particular BU is given that the company has a good name in its field. I want the CEO to know this and to ensure this doesn't happen to the new hires. The BU has an aggressive hiring plan. Naturally, I am bitter about the whole experience.

Is there any harm in sending an email just to the CEO? Legally, will there be any implications? Will my action impact the reference check? I know I am never going to work again for this employer. But our industry is small and my whistle-blowing can potentially impact my job search and relationships. "
Layoff story - Sorry to vent...,"Been at a company for four years and had been doing well. 

Last fall my direct manager asked me to submit a salary review request so he could reward me with a raise. Told me he wanted to make sure I was happy. 
Two months later the company was sold. Boss tells me the salary increase will be delayed, but be patient. 
In May he calls me into his office and tells me the raise was approved and gave me the amount - I told him I was hoping for a little more, but that was fine. 
Three days later he sends me a chat writing that the raise was formally approved for a bit more than he had told me.

What does it mean when the job opening position is taken down?,"So my husband was laid off in November of 2023 and his old colleague reached out to him and opened a position for my hubby to apply and told him to apply for it at his company. His old colleague is a Director at that company. Since then the process has been very long and my husband had 3 interviews with a couple directors and a manager. After he applied, he got the email that said he’s short listed. That was a month ago. Now the  position is gone and we haven’t heard anything from them. They had warned him the hiring process will be long but that was back in December. Now we are going to be in March soon. I don’t know what to expect for my husband..Any ideas?

Learn Your Local State Employment and Wage Laws,"Hi, recently been laid off.  It sucks and I am sorry for those who are feeling the pain, especially the ones that were productive and really produced great work.  My heart goes out to you all.  

I recommend, regardless if you are currently laid off or it “feels” like a lay off is looming, go to your state government website and learn about your labor laws.   

Most government websites have helpful information.  Some companies are not following the protocols and it is important that they do for many given reasons.   They also provide simplified summary of the laws and provide connection that can help. 

Although there isn’t much you can do when a lay off takes place, there is an advantage to knowing these laws and ensuring your company treats you in accordance with the laws.

I know it sounds like a pretty “duh” recommendation, but many wait and wait, then a lay off hits.   By that time, you are rushing and never get to it.  You may have been cheated out of wages and other benefits, without evening knowing it.  I know because it happened to me.  "

Referendum Time,"Time to change the law via state referendum. Any firm that lays off part of their workforce must also layoff the C suite positions and they loose their stock options and golden parachutes. Layoffs are due to mismanagement and executives should not be rewarded for bad decisions.

Your personal stress-relief post-layoff? Physical health related,"Ugh the title sounds so much worse than I mean. 

Recently laid off (Jan 18), 1 month severance and 3 months paid COBRA; last paycheck is coming in March 1. 

Obviously, the stress is ramping and I’m trying to make sure I’m taking time for myself between job applications; longer dog walks, reading the books I meant to but previously couldn’t, more time in the gym. 

But it’s not helping. I’ve woken up the last few days with the most intense jaw and neck pain from clenching my jaw in my sleep, and it’s lasting further into each day. My back is constantly aching. I’m starting to take melatonin, listen to bedtime meditations, and drink sleepytime tea, but I’m dreading going to sleep every night. Because, as relaxed as I am when I go to bed, I’m still waking up with my jaw practically locked. 

I was able to schedule a dentist appointment while my COBRA is still in effect; I think I’ll ask for a night guard. But aside from that … I’m stumped. 

Is there anything I can do to mitigate and relieve this tension? Im so afraid of cracking my teeth and being unable to afford a fix, but more afraid of the future repercussions. TIA!"
10 to 20% paycuts companywide,"I received an email from our CEO letting us know the company will be imposing a 10% pay cut across the board anywhere from 6 to 9 months. 
To be fair, the executives are taking a 20% cut.

It’s not ideal, but I guess it’s better than layoffs, right?"

What to do on my break after layoff,"I got laid off last week, and I want to take a break for a couple of weeks before jumping into job search. 

Please brainstorm and suggest what kinds of things I can do to stay away from social media/TV and junk food, and focus on grounding and recharging myself."
Can the company that laid me off make me work during the 60 day WARN notice?,"Throwaway in case my job sees this. I was laid off early January, most of my coworkers turned in their laptops and badges but are still getting paid through the WARN notice. At the end of the 60 days we are supposed to get severance and our bonus.

My manager is asking me to do a series of increasingly more time consuming tasks. I'm getting annoyed because I want to focus on job interviews and applications. When I pushed back, they said the 60 days is supposed to ensure a smooth transition.

I don't want to burn bridges, but I also will never ask them for references because I already have good ones. 

Can they force me to work or can I just say I'm turning in my laptop Monday morning so I can accept new opportunities?

Thanks for the advice!"
Did i sabotage my chances of getting an offer?,So long story short i had 3 rounds of interviews that went extremely well i would say. One was when a panel interview where they all gave me incredible feedback. So the panel interview was supposed to be the final round but after that interview the Director of product wanted to meet again just to clarify a 3month gap on my resume(from August to now) instead of my lying i was completely honest and said i took this time of to reevaluate if this field was what i wanted to pursue long term and i studied for a potential career change into application security. After this interview it was supposed to be an offer or rejection but instead now the Senior Director of product wanted to interview with me as well and this was meant to be a casual conversation but of course he wanted to also dive into the reason for me contemplating a career change. Our interview went really well he said he enjoyed the convo. A day later i reached out to the recruiter and he said things were trending nicely and he was still working on getting everyone’s feedback. 3 days later and i still haven’t heard nothing even after i texted him saying i  have some other final round interviews that could potentially lead to offers. Did i screw myselg by being honest

Started my approved two week PTO two days ago and got laid off today,"I got a phone call that I’m being laid off today. I’ve worked there for 6 years so they are giving me 6 weeks of pay. I’m going on my approved PTO tomorrow to another country and will be back in a week and a half.

The agreement says I need to sign and return in 14 days so I just asked them to extend my severance package agreement to 28 days so I can talk to a lawyer. 

I’m a big frustrated because if I knew I was going to get laid off, I wouldn’t be going on a vacation and instead save that money because I won’t be having a job. 

What’s the best way to negotiate the severance payment and what seems right to say and should I avoid saying?

Can I get more than 6 weeks of pay so I can look for a job when I get back from my trip. My trips are non-refundable. 

I reached out to an lawyer to discuss farther, but is this even a case? I’m worried if I sue, it’ll damage my career.

Laid-off and received letter about over-payment from former company,"I was laid off from a big tech company earlier this year and just received a letter from them about how they overpaid me to the tune of $1700. They’re asking me to pay this amount back. I’m frustrated and find it so uncomfortable to have to pay this amount to a multi-billion dollar company that has let me go, all because of their own accounting error. Curious if anyone knows what the consequences are if I ignore this letter? They don’t list any out or provide a deadline for the re-payment. I’m California-based and, since I was laid off, they don’t have any future payroll for me to deduct the amount from. Thanks for any guidance!"

How do you conquer the melancholy feeling?,"I work in the call-centre,and there is a possibility that I could get lay- off anytime soon because the place is becoming extremely quiet for the past few months.

Knowing this, I cant seem to do anything productive about it.  So much negative emotions washed over me. Its kind of scary. Is like winter blues. When you have too many negative emotions, they just cloud your mind and weaken your body system. Most of the time I just want to sleep - to cover myself under a blanket and wait for the next morning so that the emotions can be stabilised. Then this wave of negative emotion washed over me again.

This job is the only income stream I have. My biggest regret is that I didnt save up any money. I worked at the same company for over 3 years. The job can be stressful and gives me anxiety, but at least I am employed and make money. I became relaxed, and treated myself with takeaway foods and got myself into expensive hobbies.  I was spell-bound and got carried away with buying expensive  plant and collecting anime, action figures etc.

Last week, one of my collegues whom I got along with  well, had resigned without telling me! I was crushed for the past few days. I didnt have the chance to congratulate him because I had been rostered off.I felt lost, confused and jealous. I was confused about my feelings towards this person whom I barely know,  and felt strange why his departure can make me feel sad. I was jealous because he was able to ultilised his time effectively by finding another job fast, knowing the ship might tip any time soon.

After my last day in february 5th - i was paid on feb 10th which was a full paycheck and then on feb 25th i was paid a full paycheck which was a pay period from feb 1st - 15th. 

is my “severance” pay from the month i was working from jan 5th - feb 5th or is the severance on top of that? because i woke up today expecting to be paid and there was nothing there. i’m very confused. "

Are there any legal options I can pursue? Initially, I was understanding of their financial situation, but now I believe they are financially stable since they have begun paying the remaining employees' salaries. That makes me so mad. I am open for any suggestion."
Concerns of further job losses as Barclays cut costs by £2bn,"The bank did not specify how many jobs are expected to go as part of the sweeping cost-cutting drive in the coming years, after it last year revealed to cut about 5,000 full-time jobs across the global business over 2023, largely affecting back office and support roles.

Max  Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge, said he thinks a 20 percent reduction in headcount in the bank’s corporate and investment bank is needed to achieve the savings target, an amount which he said “would not impact day-to-day operations”.

Kathleen Brooks, a research director at XTB, said Barclays’ new financial targets “set a high bar”  and involve “building a greater institution than what Barclays is today”, but added that will mean job cuts.

Not given fair procedural process on performance management plan advice please?,"I’ve been with this company for 6 years, I’ve had 3 promotions over that period. Last week I was blindsided by a Performance management plan by a new manager. She’s been with the company for 3 months. How is she legally able to provide a fair performance plan with limited time at the business and she would also still be on probation? She also hasn’t provided any tangible or measurable goals, no support or plan for next steps. I have been requesting the Performance plan policy for over a week now with no sign from HR or her boss. Continuing to be told “we will get it to you shortly” HR was on leave when plan presented to me, how could it have been created without their input / oversight. I also wasn’t offered a support person for that meeting. No verbal feedback. She now continues to send excessive emails and additional task requests. Fully aware they are trying to manage me out but I feel I shouldn’t go down without a fight.

Laid off at a very bad personal time in my life,"I was laid off recently, and in the week+ before the layoff, I was already devastated watching my last parent nearly die, and then slowly recover in the hospital. I’ve been spending my whole day in their hospital room - I’m helping inform the doctors and nurses of their history, advocating for them, and helping them in the intermediary unit since it is unfortunately understaffed. When I had my job, I could sometimes work in their room, and at their house, I worked at night. Although it was difficult, I was getting it done on time, minus some sick hours here and there.

Now I’m laid off with not much severance, and I don’t feel I have much mental capacity to interview. It took me 9 months to get my first job out of college (I didn’t have any internships; big mistake). Then it took me 5 months to get my second one. I do well in behavioral interviews usually, and can do really well in the occasional logic quiz - but I always get nervous during tech interviews. And I realize that both of those job searches were in time crunches, like this one will now be.

My friend made the point that we’re knowledgeable at things we’re passionate about, and so if I put in a similar amount of time into LeetCode, that could significantly help. Unfortunately, this is one of the most stressful times of my life, for even more reasons than what I’ve described above. 

Has anyone else been in the same boat, and if so, how did you make it out?

Thank you"

Laid-Off & company is asking for work to hold them over post termination date,"I was laid off two weeks ago, but was given about a months notice with my last day being in Feb. I was asked to complete a full handover of documents, platforms, etc. in order to receive agreed upon severance payments. 

Now my company is asking that I provide them with a few months of content to hold them over post termination date while they search for someone to backfill my position (they’re making my position more junior and moving locations). How would you approach? I no longer need the company for references all my managers have been let go, but want to ensure they can’t say I’m not complying with agreement."
How to handle a recruiter call and be successful 100% of the time,"If you are lucky to get a recruiter call in this market, you must be referred to the hiring manager.  With experience and a few things in mind, you can make this recruiter -> hiring manager conversion close to 100%. I.e. each recruiter call should yield you first round hiring manager interviews.

Want to share my own experience. Post layoff, applied to over 2500 jobs and spoke with tens of recruiters. And, of course, I have had experience with recruiters throughout the last 20 years of my career. 

First, you must understand tha. what brings you here.. bla bla: In this question, remember you are talking to someone who doesn't quite understand the domain. The recruiter is checking off some skill boxes, seeing your enthusiasm, and gauging your health as a candidate- communication, articulation, etc. So keep it broad. keep it high level. Keep it close to the job description. Don't veer off. She may ask you some situational questions. go a little deeper but come across as confident and communicate succinctly here. She is NOT testing your knowledge or experience. This is just to see that you are the person whose resume she has picked and some substance backs words.

a.) How likely are you to make it in the interview process relative to other candidates she works with?

b.) How ready are you to move ahead with the recruiting process?

c.) How likely are you to accept a job offer if given?

&#x200B;

So, could you step back and develop a firm understanding of what success means for a recruiter? Because it will help you position yourself differently. Here is an example. Now that you know that a recruiter cares about conversion rate (i.e., whether you will accept the offer or not), and let's say you have a job offer lined up, if the recruiter asks you, ""Do you have other conversations, you are in right now,"" - should you tell her about this impending offer? The answer is NO. If you do, your conversion rate is in question in her mind. Even though you may be outstanding, you are a low-probability convert. So, this understanding of recruiter motivations is critical.

Ok, so let's take a look at some common questions you will get from a recruiter and how to answer them.

a.) **So tell me about you**a.) So tell me about you. Keep this one. Do not fuck yourself on this one. The correct answer (if you want to move to the hiring manager round) is ""What is the salary? budget for this role?"". yes, respond to this question with your questions. In many states, they are required to answer that. I will give you suggestions for those where they still need to be. But regardless, start with that. If this doesn't work, share that "" growth and scope are my most important aspects. I want to grow and expand in my professional experience over the next few years. So compensation is not the most important expectation. working with smart people, learning something new, and applying my experience is at the top. I am flexible on salary"". If pressed more, give her a WIDE range acceptable to you. Whatever you do, do not box yourself into a number. This can only hurt your chances of being pushed to the hiring manager round

b.) **What are your salary expectations:** Do not fuck yourself on this one. The correct answer (if you want to move to the hiring manager round) is ""What is the salary? budget for this role?"" . yes, respond to this question with your questions. In many states, they are required to answer that. I will give you some other suggestions for those where they still need to be. But regardless, start with that. If this doesn't work, then share that ""for me, growth and scope is the most important aspect. I want to grow, and I want to expand in my professional experience over the next few years. So compensation is not the most important expectation. working with smart people, learning something new, and applying my experience is at the top. I am flexible on salary"". If pressed more, give her a WIDE range acceptable to you. Whatever you do, do not box yourself into a number. This can only hurt your chances of being pushed to the hiring manager round

c.) **Why are you looking?** keep this one brief, too. If she asks you explicitly about layoffs, then you can always disclose. But if not, then you don't need to talk about that. Talk about forward looking goals. Talk about APPLYING your experience to company x and why you think it will be a terrific match. Refrain from talking about what YOU want; talk about how what you want will benefit the company and add value. For example - I have worked in manufacturing tech, and I've worked in core software engineering. Your company is building a lot of engineering products, and my expertise can be applied to this new growth of your company, and that's very exciting. something like that...

I'll leave you all with these tips, but I will add more to this post later. If you have recruiter questions you find hard to answer, put them below, and I'll share my perspective.

Telus Canada and International will have potential layoffs based on new management. Overhead Dir.Ops.,"Title: Urgent SOS 🆘 - Battling Toxicity at Telus International 😰

Hey Reddit fam,

🚨 Need your support in navigating the storm at Telus International, especially within the Google Cloud Division. It's gotten so toxic, and I'm at a breaking point. 😓

My manager and the gang seem determined to kick me to the curb, playing mind games that are destroying my mental health. 🤯 Some newly appointed managers are pushing us to the limit, treating our mental well-being like a punching bag. 🥊

We're constantly under a microscope, doing their bidding, and drowning in extra workload as if we don't deserve a moment to breathe. 😩 Left my previous job for this rollercoaster, and now I'm questioning why I hopped on.

This company, sitting pretty in the top 1%, is abusing the 99%, and it's disheartening. 😔 Sometimes capitalism feels more like a poison than a solution.

Feeling helpless as my manager hands over governance rights to another employee, making the entire environment feel like a depressing classroom. 🏫

We, the tech wizards, are the ones adding value, yet they think they can do whatever they please. The setup is making it clear they want us out.

🙏 Please help! I'm putting in the work, yet they're trying to show us the exit. Any advice, support, or words of wisdom are appreciated. Let's lift each other up in this challenging time. 💪✨

Warn others!!!! Don't join telus canada or international."
Has anyone tried reaching out directly to 100's of recruiters / HM's instead of applying online?,"Has this worked for you? What has been the challenge to doing so?

We have seen success in reaching out to 10-15 folks via email for every company we apply to. At the very least, it's been effective at networking and, in some cases, referrals. So, for example, if the candidate is applying to Proofpoint, we will get work emails for 10-15 Proofpoint employees - hiring managers, recruiters, etc.- and try to get on the phone, email, or Google Meet. 

Sometimes, hiring managers and recruiters can be helpful if they see you as a valuable candidate.

"42M laidoff Engineering Manager could use some suggestions for next steps, please?","Folks, would appreciate some recommendations for where to go from here.

Background:

B.S. in Computer Science

2004 Software Engineer Internship

2005 Software Engineer Internship

2006 Engineering Internship (Customer Engineering/Engineering Support) at a Megacorp Telecom company

2007 Hired full time as Engineer at same company (Customer Engineering/Engineering Support)

2010 Promoted to Senior Eng.

2015 Laid off

2016 Hired as Technical Account Manager at small SW company

2019 Promoted to Manager of Technical Services (Managing 3 teams: SW Dev, TAM, and Client Services)

2022 Laid off

Note: I was really good and enjoyed coding, but unintentionally I went down the path of Support Engineering, by the time I realized that support sucks, it was too late,  and was never able to make a change back to SW Engineering, therefore, I don't have any professional coding experience on my resume other than the internships (although I could probably fake it if I needed)

Since my layoff I've been wallowing in depression and indecision as to what direction to take?

Back in 2023, I applied to hundreds of jobs, had about 15 interviews, rejected from all, got discouraged, gave up, more wallowing.

I was applying mostly to Solutions Engineering Management, Program Management, Project Management type jobs...

I would like to work a remote job.

I've been thingking about taking some Web Dev and Data Science/AI bootcamp courses, and try to get a Dev or Data Science type job, but with AI and all the recent layoffs, not sure there is much future in that

Or I guess I could keep trying to go for Management/Program Mgmt type positions, but seems like there's not a lot of future in those either...

Any ideas?"

Directv Layoffs Oct 2023,"Another round of layoffs were announced today to management. Frontline employees were offered voluntary layoffs, with forced layoffs coming to them next. Sad times!"
How would you want to be treated in a deferred layoff?,"Odd situation at my company that I haven’t been able to find support for elsewhere. 

Layoffs happened, some were immediate, but a vast majority were told they are still part of the company for the next 6 months, at the end of which they will get their severance and bonus (assuming they don’t just stop doing their jobs, since their performance review is a baseline qualifier). 

Understandably this is extremely awkward now for the next 6 months while those who are staying (like me) and those who are going (a lot of my department) work together. Most of their roles will be backfilled by offshore hires and part of their 6 month stay is helping onboard (I know, I know, it’s a weird thing to ask of people you aren’t keeping). 

I and my managers are fully committed to helping place these people in the next 6 months, reviewing resumes, making intros/networking, career planning and strategizing, etc. But I just feel like as a teammate it is impossible for me to come across as genuine when we talk about how things are. On the one hand, team meetings where we discuss the future are awkward, but on the other, they are still here for 6 months so we still have work we are doing. 

If you were one of the employees being laid off in 6 months, how would you want to be treated? Should we ignore the elephant in the room? Have separate team meetings to segregate topics around future growth? (That feels like it would be exclusive and presumptuous but I’m at a loss). I feel like if we act “normal” like including bonding games in team meetings like we usually do is insensitive, but talking about it constantly and saying “I’m here for you if you need to talk” comes off not genuine and sort of rubbing it in. No one wins. And maybe that’s just how it is. But if there is any way for us to improve this I would love some perspective from people who have experienced a layoff. I can of course sympathize, as I was fully prepared to be one of the layoffs, but in the end I wasn’t and I know it isn’t fully the same."

Explained: Factors Driving Tech Layoffs in 2023,"The pandemic witnessed a hiring spree in the tech sector. But employers are now resorting to mass [layoffs](https://us.sganalytics.com/blog/what-are-the-reasons-factors-and-impact-of-tech-layoffs-2023/) due to the upcoming economic recession. While over 150,000 people were affected by the 2022 tech layoffs, the wave is expected to continue in 2023 as well, with over 68,500 new job cuts in the first month of 2023 alone. Media coverage has focused on the top firms behind the layoffs as well as the consequences for employees. 

As a result, qualified individuals with strong education and experience often remain in for a long time in the market or end up switching careers. But the recent tech layoff has presented valuable insights into what led to the mass job cuts and why.  It all hints at one question - Could this be a reason behind the mass layoffs?"

Green Day's Good Riddance... 

&#x200B;

I farewell to my good friend just today before he moves to different state. He was impacted some time ago, and I know I may face the same fate sooner or later. 

I always loved this song since I first listen this song from MTV when I was teenager. This song has been friend of mine for all important moments of my life, especially when things are rough tough and sad. Interestingly, this song came out from the restaurant we were having lunch together before we finally farewell, then my eyes become red. Damn, they put way too much onion in my sub... 

The original intention of this song is about breakup, because Billie wrote this song after he splits with his old GF. However, I dare to say, this song can be the perfect one for anyone who is ending a cycle and beginning a new phase of the life.

Need some advice after being laid off,"So I’m an immigrant in the US who worked as a Data Analyst. I was laid off back in January. It’s been almost 2 months and I still haven’t been able to find a job in tech (can’t apply for any other type of jobs due to visa restrictions)

I feel like I’m doing something wrong while applying which is why I’m not even able to land a single interview. First, I was (and still am) intimidated by the ats system. Therefore, before I apply for a job I tailor my resume to that particular position adding every keyword that i can add hoping that my resume would clear the ats and be viewed by a recruiter. Needless to say, this is time consuming and I can only apply for 20-25 jobs per day while I should be applying to at least 100. 

So I need advice regarding the ATS system. Is the ATS as dreadful as people make it out to be? If my resume doesn’t match at least 85% of the keywords to the JD, then will my resume be auto-rejected without a human even viewing it? Is the only strategy that I can apply, manually updating my resume for each and every job?

What’s the best way to proceed forward? I have 2 masters degrees from a reputed US university and 3 years of professional experience within US. Any kind of advice (or even a referral for that matter) will be VERY helpful. Thank you :)

Need some help. What do you think my company is going to do?,"We had a RIF over a month ago (one of a few in the last year). After the RIF my manager moved my direct report under someone less experienced than me. My manager told me that leadership didn't have confidence in my ability to manage. My manager proceeded to tell me that it's because I'm distracted by my wife's pregnancy (big HR no no) and gave me a bunch of bs reasons that don't actually correlate to my performance. I point blank told my manager that if there isn't a future for me at the company, let's not delay this. They said that is very much a possibility but we'll have frequent communications.

After that, I ended up going to an employment lawyer. The lawyer recommended I document everything and go to HR because it seems like they are pregnancy discriminating me. The lawyer said if they fire me for going to HR in retaliation, I could negotiate compensation for the time I'm unemployed. 

So I did that which led to me having a meeting with HR and my manager. It seemed like one big formality so they could cover their ass. Nothing was resolved.

Fast forward to now, my manager is being really nice to me. Has only given positive feedback, but has excluded me from a few recent conversations that I should've been involved in. 

To me, it feels like I bought myself some time for them to fire me/lay me off. My parental leave is in a couple of months and I'm wondering if they will pull the trigger before, during, or right after parental leave. 

Curious if others have been in a similar situation and may know what I should expect. After everything that happened, I don't want to be at this company and am interviewing, but the uncertainty has been tough to sit with. Any input/guidance would be appreciated. Thank you."

Leveraging your LLC to fill in gaps on your resume,"Has anyone had success in leveraging their side business to bridge career transitions? Specifically, I'm curious about using an LLC from a side hustle to fill resume gaps without misrepresenting my experience.

I'd like to make a career shift, moving from my most recent experience as a Director of Account Management into a leadership role within Media (Programmatic and Ad Operations). One of my struggles is that I held significantly higher leadership roles in Account Management (Director) than I did in my days in Media (Manager).  

Given the job market's strong emphasis on a candidate's recent work history, I'm concerned that I might be missing out on opportunities for Director or Senior Manager roles in the media industry, as my resume doesn't currently reflect those specific titles.

To counter this, I've started a side business that aligns closely with the skill set required for the roles I'm interested in. 

This brings me to my question:

Has anyone here used a title other than ""Founder"" or ""Owner"" for their LLC to more accurately reflect the roles and responsibilities undertaken in their side business?

 How has this decision impacted your career trajectory, particularly in terms of securing future roles?

I’m so sick of bending over backwards for startups because I’m in early career, just to be berated by previous employers for “owe-ing” them more work after not being there anymore or being laid off after being given an explosive offer due to immediate needs and cut off once they decided they didn’t care anymore. Not to mention my talent and skills had been underutilized despite my best attempts. Now I’m stuck in a rock and a hard place and am left applying to 30 jobs a day just trying to stand out. How am I supposed to have impressive resumes when the only people who will give me work are startups who have no prestige before me, and I get no credit afterwards to convince employers of my skills.

"Regarding all these ""Soft Landing"" posts","You guys DO KNOW it is an election year right?

And not all sectors are being hit equally hard, at the same time

Tech and to some degree biotech over hired in 2020 and are compensating 

The rising cost to borrow money shuts down any R&D heavy industries or industries with a lot of start-ups that doesn't have their own revenue stream (so STEM based industries)

Stockbuy backs is also a factor: Exelixis laid off 13% of their staff just to have the cash runway to do a 450 million stock buyback later this year

So ofc the MSM can't say the economy is gonna crash, that's literally handing the GOP is HUGE talking piece for this year's elections. (and no, the 2008 crash is different in that it happened purely out of greed and everyone rushing to buying more houses than they can afford and banks lending them money without checking their credit histories.........this time its caused by the PPP loans + Jerome Powell). 

We wouldn't really know whether or not we have a soft or hard landing probably until 2025, at which point the election is over so whoever is president can go back to do nothing for the American middle class."

Last quarter performance review which was 3 months ago, our senior director told me that he could potentially promote me to a senior role and give me more compensation early January which is now. I spoke with my direct manager today and he wasn’t aware about it but will speak with the senior director. He was confident that I have more opportunities to grown within the company even 2 to 3 years from now etc. Anyways, he called me back 10 mins after our performance review and that they’re still figuring out the budgeted compensation but they both agree I deserve more compensation and recognition based on my performance.

I know there’s been layoffs left and right with the company but half of me is confident I wouldn’t get laid off but who really knows right?

I didn't have the best relationship with my manager, but I always showed respect and did my best to follow their footprint for success.  Regardless, the company let me know they I was being let go for these reasons, and that was that.  What was a bit confusing to me is that the company offered me a generous severance package (<1 year employment, 8 weeks pay).  And while I understand the purpose of severance packages (really more about protecting the company), they also waived the non-compete clause within the severance agreement.  I've read through everything thoroughly, shared it with friends who specialize in corporate law, and there is nothing pointing to why I shouldn't sign it and take the payout.

With that context, where I'm struggling is with why I was offered a generous severance -- did the company just want me out given the relationship with my manager?

I personally would feel better knowing I was part of an ongoing stealth lay off period (there were silent waves of other employees being let go prior to my termination), or terminated for a reason other than performance.

Net/net, I'm happy to be out, and already on to a new job, but would love to get anyone's thoughts here on the situation as I personally struggle with the idea of ""being fired"".  Thanks Reddit fam!"
Rejected for unemployment and now no response?,"Was forced to resign from my consulting job in June in return for 2 months compensation (this involuntary transition is normal for many consulting companies). I am still not receiving unemployment benefits because the department rejected my first claim and have since been unresponsive to my appeals.

Has anyone experienced this and does anyone have advice on how to get their attention and get my payments? I live in CA."

Did you announce your layoff on social media?,"In my industry it's quite common for people to announce layoffs on social media. I haven't done it yet. I just wasn't ready for everyone to know, and I think it was a good decision. I could not handle all the reactions at once. "
Can they force me to take vacation?,"I have been laid off after six months employment. During my six months I was not given a job description or given any assignments. Nothing to do. (I found out two months after starting that my company had been acquired and that the conversations had started the same month they hired me). Now they have terminated me along with several other coworkers. They have given me one month notice and two weeks severance pay, and they will pay for my accrued vacation. This is all stated in the agreement that I signed. I am in California, and labor law indicated that unused vacation days have to be paid out. Now I have a month employment left  and have told my boss many times that I am available for work, but instead she wants me to take my 21 days of vacation, during my notice period. Can she force me?"

Layoff,"Got impacted by a mass layoff at my previous employer after 2 years. Going through a tough breakup at the same time and have to find a job ASAP due to visa restrictions.

How does a layoff affect job search and interview conversations,"I was laid off last week. I’m still coming to terms with it because I worked very hard at my company in a near-thankless role for 2.5 years and it ended in this. I had six different managers during my 2.5 years at the company and with every manager I kept trying to make a case for my promotion to learn how I could work towards it and not only did the goal post keep changing, there was so much toxicity that a couple of my managers left just because of that. Amid workplace harassment complaints and unprompted criticism and disrespect, I chose to persist at the company in hopes of finally being promoted at the end of this year but they cut me out as part of their lay offs (I wasn’t the only one to go, I was part of a list of people). 

Anyway, I wanted to understand from the community here- what do you normally say in interviews if the interviewer asks “why did you leave your previous role?”. Is it wise to say that one was laid off? Does it have a negative implication on one’s job search? I also have personal matters because of which I need to travel out of Canada- can I say instead that I had to leave the company to tend to personal matters for the time-being? Which of these is less detrimental to a prospective opportunity? I asked my employer for a recommendation letter from my manager to support my job search but the HR said their standard process is that they will respond to a background check request, didn’t say anything about a letter. Should I directly and politely try to contact my former manager to request for a recommendation letter? 

I don’t know much about what happens next and fear and doubt are beginning to creep in. Any help for my path forward is much appreciated.



Update- 

I received a job offer a few days ago. Honestly, at first it wasn’t easy to say I was laid off but I did it anyway- transparently and confidently explaining the circumstances if a recruiter asked me. My initial dismay later changed into self assurance that I’m not the only one going through this and it doesn’t reflect on my capabilities (this was a journey, I can talk about it if anyone’s interested). Some recruiters did flinch when I told them I was laid off. I could sense that they’re not exactly happy knowing that they’re speaking to a candidate that’s out of job. And by this time, I was repelled by such people because I knew they’re judging me for something no one has any control over and even if I were to get hired at that company, I could expect others to treat me like I’m less than, only because I was laid off. Maybe just my viewpoint but such conversations were always unsettling and the recruiter sounded like bad news. Some recruiters straight up sounded so disinterested as if they were doing me a favour just by showing up for the interview. And these were respected companies they represented so I was disappointed to see how they can treat candidates. 

Meanwhile, the HR from my previous company (that laid me off) was constantly checking my LinkedIn profile (once every week) for months and even when I unfollowed the company, she sent me a request to follow it back. No idea what she wanted but I thought the sneaking up was unnecessary. Turns out *drumroll* that team couldn’t function too well after they let me go so they posted a role for _two_ designations above me, as my replacement (strangely, this reassured me that I was capable of so much more and it’s their loss that they wouldn’t simplify their task by just promoting me _once_ and saving themselves so much money and time). 

Ultimately, months later, I interviewed for a company that was far out of my scope. It is within an industry I had no exposure to and I knew it was a long shot but I was sure I was up to the challenge. I gave the interviews knowing I could do it all and the hiring manager was so happy with me that even though I didn’t fit into what he was looking for, he placed me with another team. This was really an experience I felt respected within and I must say, it must’ve been partly because I was so certain of myself. 

So all is well that ends well, I suppose. Light at the end of the tunnel. "

Severance pay,"Does anyone have experience with severance pay calc? I was approved for 6 months off for maternity (unpaid) to have time with my child. Upon my return, they mentioned my position is not available which I knew would be the case. I was supposed to be moved to a different role but one is not available. For me, i prefer this because I want more time with the baby. I will do some contractor work for them at a nice hourly rate so better for me at the end of the day. As they treat this as my position being removed, they are ‘laying me off’ in their view and because of that they will give me severance pay. I want to ensure they don’t give me an extremely low severance because I know they had paid some very hefty once previously. Anyone has experience?

Facts:
-$160k annual pay
-10% annual bonus (paid in March usually)
-401k er match (annual paid in March but won’t be vested)
- worked Jan-June 2022
-3 year tenure
-head of department
-6 people team
-i have phantom stock if they sell the company (worth $150k) which ends as soon as they terminate me
-2 year noncompete to not work in the same industry (accounting field so not a big deal)

4 weeks + 2 months of outplacement. I do not need outplacement at all
